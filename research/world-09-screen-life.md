## A) Topic Definition and Scope

Screen life cinema is the form in which the entire diegesis is confined to a digital display — a computer desktop, a phone screen, a tablet interface, a video call window. Social media horror is the mode in which social platforms — their architectures, affordances, metrics, and behavioral norms — function as the primary setting, antagonist, or narrative engine of a horror work. These two currents are distinct but convergent. Screen life is a formal constraint (the frame is the screen); social media horror is a thematic and structural commitment (the platform is the world). Their intersection — horror that takes place on screens depicting social platforms — is the territory this brief maps.

For PHANTASMATA, this domain is not adjacent but central. The project's creative mandate specifies "found digital over found tape: present-tense digital world as horror surface." The screen-capture output format — one of five designated PHANTASMATA formats — is native to this domain. Where World Research Brief 01 (Found Footage) traced the epistemic lineage from diegetic camera to digital interface, and Brief 02 (Digital Paranoia) mapped internet-native horror as collaborative folklore, this brief addresses the specific formal problem of the screen itself as horror space: not a camera pointed at the world, but a device rendering its own mediated reality as the only reality available.

The distinction from found footage is structural. Found footage posits a camera operator — a body behind the lens, a hand that trembles. Screen life eliminates the camera operator and replaces it with a user — a cursor, a click, a scroll. The user does not point at reality; the user navigates an interface that is already a representation. In found footage, the horror is what the camera captures. In screen life, the horror is what the interface renders, filters, mediates, and conceals. The epistemological shift is from "can I trust what I see?" to "can I trust the system through which I see?"

Social media horror extends this further. The platform's logic — algorithmic curation, engagement metrics, parasocial dynamics, performative identity, viral amplification — is itself the horror mechanism. The monster is not a ghost in the machine but the machine's operating logic applied to human psychology. When Spree's rideshare driver livestreams murders for followers, the horror is the metric: the kill count as engagement count, the body as content. When Cam's camgirl discovers a digital double, the horror is replaceability: the platform does not care who performs, only that performance continues.

This brief consolidates these two research streams because PHANTASMATA's output formats require both: the screen-capture format needs screen life's formal vocabulary (cursor, notification, tab, typing indicator), and the mock-post format needs social media horror's understanding of platform logic (algorithmic feed, engagement signal, comment section, parasocial address). Together, they constitute the technical and conceptual foundation for PHANTASMATA's most platform-native outputs — the outputs most likely to be encountered in the same contexts as the genuine digital artifacts they mimic, and therefore the outputs whose epistemic destabilization potential is highest.

The project's core principle — "horror as epistemology, not genre decoration" — finds one of its most direct contemporary expressions in this domain. Screen life and social media horror do not primarily frighten through monsters, violence, or supernatural threat. They frighten through the destabilization of the interface's reliability: the inability to determine whether a profile is genuine, whether a message was sent by a human, whether the screen is showing you what is actually happening or what the algorithm has determined you should see. When the tool through which you understand reality becomes unreliable, the horror is not in the content but in the medium.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What formal rules govern screen life cinema as codified by Bekmambetov, and how do they differ from found footage's formal contract?
2. How do specific digital interface elements — the typing indicator, the cursor, the notification badge, the browser tab — function as horror instruments?
3. What is the formal taxonomy of social media horror: which platform logics produce which horror modes?
4. How does screen life interact with the three director dials, and which settings are native to this domain?
5. What is the relationship between screen life cinema's formal constraint and PHANTASMATA's screen-capture output format?
6. How does parasocial horror map onto $KON_SPIRAL, and what does Kon's 1997 anticipation of this dynamic reveal about the form's deep structure?
7. What ethical parameters govern PHANTASMATA's deployment of these techniques, given that outputs circulate on the same platforms they depict?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. The Screen Life Concept: Bekmambetov's Rules

Timur Bekmambetov did not invent screen life cinema, but he named it, codified its rules, and industrialized its production through his company Bazelevs. His rules, articulated from 2015 onward, constitute a formal system:

**Rule 1: The screen is the frame.** The entire film takes place on a screen. No shot exists that is not renderable as a screen capture. There is no "outside" the screen within the diegesis.

**Rule 2: All action is interface-native.** Characters act by typing, clicking, scrolling, composing, deleting. A character's emotional state is communicated through interface interaction: how fast they type, whether they delete what they typed, which tab they switch to, how long they hover over a button before clicking.

**Rule 3: The user is the protagonist.** The person controlling the screen is the POV character. Their identity is communicated through digital behavior: desktop wallpaper, browser bookmarks, notification settings, typing speed, music library. The cursor is their hand; the search query is their thought.

**Rule 4: Time is real-time or compressed through interface logic.** Screen life films tend toward real-time pacing but compress time through interface conventions: loading bars, file transfer indicators, timestamps on messaging threads.

**Rule 5: Sound is diegetic to the device.** The audio landscape is what the device's speakers and microphone would capture. Non-diegetic score is forbidden or severely constrained.

These rules produce a formal system with distinctive horror properties. The screen life horror film cannot use most of conventional cinema's fear instruments — no low-angle shots, no tracking shots through corridors, no orchestral stings, no chiaroscuro lighting. It must generate dread from the interface itself: the three-dot typing indicator that appears, persists, and disappears without producing a message. The cursor moving across a screen when no one should be controlling it. The notification from an account that should not exist. The browser tab that was not there a moment ago.

The constraint is productive because it forces horror into the viewer's native environment. A conventional horror film takes place in a haunted house, an abandoned hospital, a dark forest — spaces the viewer does not inhabit. A screen life horror film takes place on the same desktop interface the viewer uses daily. The haunted house is the laptop. The dark corridor is the browser history. The basement the protagonist should not descend into is the link they should not click. Horror potency is directly proportional to the viewer's familiarity with the depicted interface.

The screen life form also introduces a specific relationship to *liveness* that found footage lacks. Found footage is past-tense by definition — the footage was *found*, meaning it was produced before the viewer encountered it. Screen life can be present-tense: the viewer watches events unfold on a screen in real time, and the screen's own temporal markers (clock, timestamps, "Active now" indicators) authenticate the present moment. This present-tense possibility is crucial for PHANTASMATA's video-log and screen-capture formats, which can exploit the ambiguity between "recording of a past event" and "live capture of a current event" — both are plausible interpretations of a screen recording, and the ambiguity between them is a productive horror space.

For PHANTASMATA, Bekmambetov's rules are a starting framework, but the project's outputs require adaptation. A PHANTASMATA screen-capture is not a feature film but a fragment — a screenshot, a 30-second screen recording, a captured notification panel. The grammar is the same (everything is interface-native, the cursor is presence, the notification is event); the scale is different. PHANTASMATA screen-captures are closer to found digital artifacts than to screen life cinema: the equivalent of a recovered hard drive's contents, not a feature-length film composed on that hard drive. This distinction matters formally: the fragment does not explain itself, does not provide narrative context, and does not resolve. It is evidence without a case — and the viewer's compulsion to construct the case from the evidence is the horror's engine.

### B2. Unfriended and the Slasher-Interface Synthesis (2014)

Levan Gabriadze's Unfriended (2014), produced by Bazelevs, proved screen life horror's commercial viability and established its primary technical vocabulary. The entire film takes place on the MacBook of Blaire Lily during a group Skype call. A mysterious user — identified as Laura Barns, a classmate who committed suicide after a humiliating video was posted online — joins and kills participants one by one.

The formal achievement is the interface mechanics through which horror operates:

**The typing indicator as suspense.** When Blaire types a message, the viewer sees text composed in real time — including deletions and revisions. Blaire types "I never liked Laura," deletes it, types "I'm sorry about what happened to Laura." The delete key becomes a character-revelation device: the gap between what someone types and what they send is the gap between who they are and who they perform.

**The tab switch as dramatic irony.** While Skype occupies the center, Blaire conducts private conversations in Facebook Messenger, searches Google for "how to get rid of a ghost online," and navigates to a cyberbullying website. Each tab contains information the call participants do not have. The viewer, positioned as Blaire's computer user, sees all tabs — omniscience the characters cannot share.

**The buffering freeze as vulnerability.** When a character's video freezes — connection buffering, image pixelating — the character is visually trapped in a distorted frame. The frozen face, caught mid-expression and rendered in compression artifacts, is screen life's version of the still photograph hiding something in the background.

**The notification as intrusion.** Laura's presence is established through a notification: a new participant has joined. The same notification badge that signals a friend's message becomes the announcement of a supernatural threat. The horror contaminates the ordinary.

Unfriended mapped slasher mechanics onto digital interface with precision. Spatial isolation becomes digital isolation (a call they cannot leave). Sequential elimination becomes sequential revelation (secrets weaponized). The sequel, Unfriended: Dark Web (Stephen Susco, 2018), shifted from supernatural to technological threat — a stolen laptop connecting its owner to a predatory dark web network. The escalation marks screen life horror's maturation from genre exercise to systemic critique: the tools of connection as tools of surveillance. Dark Web also introduced a formal innovation absent from the original: the multiple-ending structure, with two different conclusions distributed to different theaters. The structural gambit — which ending did you see? — extends screen life's epistemological uncertainty beyond the screen and into the audience's social discourse about the film itself. Did you see the real ending? Is there a real ending? The film's refusal to privilege one conclusion over another mirrors the internet's refusal to privilege one version of events.

Taken together, the two Unfriended films establish the poles of screen life horror's threat spectrum: the supernatural entity that uses the interface as a haunting ground (Unfriended) and the human system that has made the interface itself predatory (Dark Web). PHANTASMATA outputs can operate at either pole or anywhere between them, but the project's commitment to epistemic horror favors the ambiguous middle — the threat whose nature (supernatural, technological, human, systemic) cannot be determined from within the interface.

### B3. Searching and the Detective-Interface Form (2018–2023)

Aneesh Chaganty's Searching (2018) demonstrated that screen life's native horror was not exclusively supernatural. David Kim (John Cho) searches for his missing daughter through her digital footprint — browser history, social media, email, video chats — entirely on screens.

The formal innovation is the **search query as interior monologue**. When David types "runaway teenager what to do" or "how to access someone's Instagram without password," each query reveals his psychological state more directly than dialogue could. The search bar becomes a confessional: the questions a person asks when no one watches are the truest index of their fear.

The **browser history as temporal structure**: David reconstructs his daughter's last days by reading her browsing history in reverse. The form naturalizes non-linear narrative — the detective reading backward through a log.

The **open tab as subtext**: at one point, David has tabs open for a news article about his daughter, a volunteer coordination page, and — visible but never clicked — a life insurance policy page. Screen life's equivalent of the meaningful prop in a background shot.

Missing (Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick, 2023) extended the format with platform updates: TikTok, Venmo transaction histories, smart home cameras, ride-share records. Each platform contributes a layer; each platform's native format shapes the kind of information it yields. Venmo transactions reveal financial relationships (who paid whom, with what emoji caption). Ride-share history reveals physical movements (where someone went, when, how often). Smart home cameras reveal domestic behavior (who enters the house, at what hour, in what emotional state). The accumulation creates a surveillance mosaic that no single platform could provide — and the horror is the realization that such a mosaic exists for everyone, assembled passively by the platforms we use daily.

For PHANTASMATA, the detective-interface mode offers a structural model for the screen-capture output format: a sequence of screenshots or screen recordings that, viewed in order, reveal a narrative through the digital traces a person leaves behind. The viewer becomes the detective, reading browser tabs, interpreting search histories, noting which messages were deleted and which were sent. The format invites active investigation rather than passive consumption — and the viewer's investigative labor binds them to the horror more effectively than passive spectatorship ever could.

### B4. Host and the Pandemic as Formal Permission (2020)

Rob Savage's Host (2020) was the screen life horror film the pandemic made inevitable. Shot during COVID lockdown on actors' personal laptops in their homes, the film takes place within a single Zoom call: six friends hire a medium for an online seance, and a malevolent entity enters through the connection. Running 56 minutes — the Zoom free-tier limit, with the ticking timer as structural countdown.

Host's achievement is less its horror content than its contextual timing. By mid-2020, the Zoom grid was the primary social interface for hundreds of millions. Audiences had already been trained to read the grid: what a frozen connection meant, what the muted microphone implied, the uncanny quality of seeing your own face in the corner while watching others.

The Zoom grid's specific horror capacity: multiple feeds visible simultaneously, each showing a different person in a different space. The viewer must scan the grid, distributing attention across feeds, and the horror can occur in any quadrant at any moment. This produces an anxiety of distributed attention that no single-camera film can replicate: the certainty that something is happening in the periphery, combined with the inability to attend to everything at once.

The film's backgrounds — actual domestic spaces of the actors — blur fiction and reality. The viewer cannot fully distinguish the set from the home, the character from the person. For PHANTASMATA, Host demonstrates the video call grid as horror space and suggests video-logs structured as recovered recorded calls: the archived therapy session, the saved FaceTime conversation no one was supposed to keep.

### B5. Profile and the Weaponized Digital Identity (2018/2021)

Bekmambetov's Profile follows a British journalist who creates a fake Facebook profile to investigate ISIS online recruitment. The film takes place on her laptop as she manages real and fake identities simultaneously.

The horror is systemic: the journalist's fake identity generates real emotional attachments. The ISIS recruiter's manipulation tactics — isolation, love-bombing, ideological framing — work despite her awareness that they are manipulation tactics. The interface facilitates this by collapsing distance between performance and sincerity: when the journalist types affectionate messages, her fingers perform the same actions they would if the affection were genuine. The body does not distinguish between the fake message and the real one.

For PHANTASMATA, Profile introduces the **weaponized profile** — the digital identity created for a purpose (investigation, catfishing, escape) that develops its own gravitational pull, drawing its creator into a performed identity that becomes more compelling than the original. This maps to $KON_SPIRAL territory: the performance that subsumes the performer.

### B6. The Social Media Horror Cycle (2018–2024)

**Cam (Daniel Goldhaber, 2018):** Alice, a camgirl, discovers her account has been taken over by a digital doppelganger that looks exactly like her but performs with greater success. The platform does not recognize Alice's claim to her own account: the doppelganger's metrics are better, and the platform's logic is metric-driven. Identity is not personhood but performance data. Cam is the most direct screen-era expression of Kon's Perfect Blue — the 21-year gap measuring the distance between Kon's anticipation and ubiquity: what he imagined as a singular anomaly (a website impersonating you) is, by 2018, a systemic condition.

**Spree (Eugene Kotlyarenko, 2020):** A rideshare driver installs cameras in his car and livestreams passenger murders, seeking virality his years of content creation never achieved. The formal insight: violence as content strategy. Murder is the content that achieves engagement. The kill count is the follower count. The comment section functions as Greek chorus: viewers react in real time, some horrified, some entertained, some offering suggestions. The chat scroll becomes the film's social context — horror as performance for an audience whose reactions modulate the killer's behavior.

**Deadstream (Joseph & Vanessa Winter, 2022):** A disgraced YouTube personality livestreams from a haunted house. The comment section is active throughout — viewers warn, mock, encourage, and in one innovation provide information the protagonist uses to survive. The audience is inside the horror, and its participation is visible in the chat scroll. For PHANTASMATA: the model of the comment section as narrative agent.

**Sissy (Hannah Barlow & Kane Senes, 2022):** A wellness influencer's curated persona masks psychopathic violence. The phone is constantly present, and the mediation layer between event and post is where the horror lives. Cecilia's immediate response to violence is to frame it for content.

**We're All Going to the World's Fair (Jane Schoenbrun, 2021):** Casey, a teenager in a rural area, participates in an online horror challenge and posts videos documenting her supposed transformation. The film maintains radical ambiguity about whether the transformation is real, performed, or self-induced. Schoenbrun's contribution: internet horror's primary affect is not fear but loneliness. The screen is not a portal to community but a substitute for it, and the horror challenge is companionate — it gives Casey something to be. A parallel figure, JLB, watches Casey's videos, and the film refuses to resolve whether his attention is parental, predatory, or projective. The interface cannot answer because the interface does not transmit interiority — only behavior.

**I Saw the TV Glow (Schoenbrun, 2024):** Not screen life, but essential context. Owen and Maddy bond over a television show. When it is cancelled, Maddy disappears. Years later she returns claiming the show was not fiction — they are characters trapped in a false reality. The film treats the screen as identity-forming medium: the show constitutes Owen and Maddy, and its cancellation is an identity crisis. This inverts the screen-horror dynamic: in Unfriended or Host, the screen is dangerous because something intrudes through it. In TV Glow, the screen is dangerous because its absence leaves the subject without a self. For PHANTASMATA, TV Glow suggests an output mode where the horror is not what the screen shows but what happens when the screen goes dark — the withdrawal of mediation as existential threat. A PHANTASMATA video-log that ends mid-stream, a screen-capture that shows a browser with no open tabs, a mock-post from an account that has deleted all its previous content — these are TV Glow operations: the horror of the empty screen, the self that has lost its medium.

Schoenbrun's two films together map the poles of screen horror's emotional range. World's Fair is the horror of the screen as only companion — the lonely intimacy of performing for an audience that may not exist. TV Glow is the horror of the screen as lost origin — the medium that made you who you are, withdrawn, leaving you in a reality that feels less real than the fiction. Between these poles, PHANTASMATA outputs can calibrate their emotional register: the screen as substitute for connection (World's Fair mode) or the screen as evidence of a more real reality that the viewer cannot access (TV Glow mode).

### B7. Platform as Form: How Architecture Shapes Horror

Each platform's native affordances create specific horror possibilities that are constitutive, not incidental.

**TikTok:** 15-60 seconds imposes compression; horror must arrive within the first scroll-stopping second. The "POV:" convention creates parasocial immediacy. The duet function allows dialogue with the unknown (a response that reveals what was in the background). The algorithm serves content based on engagement, not subscription — horror reaches viewers who did not seek it.

**Reddit:** NoSleep's "everything is true" rule creates a performative reality layer unique to the platform. The series format supports serialized horror with real-time audience interaction. The upvote system creates natural selection by engagement.

**YouTube:** Long-form supports investigation, slow-burn, evidence accumulation. The recommendation algorithm creates horror by adjacency: each recommendation slightly more extreme, producing a descent-structure that mimics horror narrative's escalatory logic.

**Instagram:** The grid creates visual patterns that anomalous content can disrupt. Stories create ephemeral evidence — content that existed yesterday and is gone today. Close-friends implies secrecy. DMs support private horror.

**Twitter/X:** The thread supports slow-reveal horror; each tweet adds a detail. The ratio quantifies public humiliation. The quote-tweet recontextualizes statements, making meaning unstable.

**Discord:** Private servers create closed communities with roles and hierarchies. The moderator as authority, the lurker as unseen presence, the kicked member as exile, the deleted message as censored evidence. Voice channels capture ambient sound — the open microphone that records what was not meant to be heard.

For PHANTASMATA, the implication is that each output format must be designed with platform specificity. A mock-post designed for Instagram must respect Instagram's visual grammar; a screen-capture depicting a Discord server must include the platform's specific interface elements (role colors, channel names, typing indicators). Platform fidelity is not decorative but structural: the horror depends on the viewer's recognition of the platform, and recognition depends on accuracy.

There is a further implication: platform choice is content choice. A PHANTASMATA output set on TikTok inherits TikTok's temporality (brief, immediate, disposable), its address mode (direct, parasocial, participatory), and its distribution logic (algorithmic, non-consensual, potentially viral). A PHANTASMATA output set on Reddit inherits Reddit's temporality (serialized, accumulative, archival), its address mode (testimonial, communal, rule-governed), and its distribution logic (upvote-driven, community-curated, semi-permanent). The platform is not a neutral container; it is a narrative instrument that shapes pacing, tone, address, and the audience's relationship to the content. Choosing a platform is choosing a horror mode.

### B8. Parasocial Horror and the $KON_SPIRAL Connection

The parasocial relationship (Horton and Wohl, 1956) — one party develops an emotional bond with a media figure unaware of the bond — has become the structural condition of influencer culture. Platform architecture actively encourages it: creators address audiences directly, share personal details, respond to comments, creating an illusion of reciprocal intimacy that the audience's scale makes structurally impossible.

Parasocial horror weaponizes this in three directions:

**The fan who believes the intimacy is real.** The viewer who cannot distinguish performed persona from private self. This maps to $KON_SPIRAL's "observer contamination" — the observer whose attention becomes a force the observed cannot escape.

**The creator who cannot stop performing.** The persona so compelling that the person behind it atrophies. The wellness influencer who cannot admit to depression. The horror content creator who cannot leave the horror behind when the camera turns off. The lifestyle vlogger whose entire domestic space has been optimized for content, leaving no room that is not a potential set, no meal that is not a potential post, no relationship that is not a potential narrative. This is Kon's Perfect Blue externalized and industrialized: Mima's crisis (am I the actress or the character?) is now the structural condition of every creator whose livelihood depends on audience engagement with a performed self. The difference in scale is the difference between tragedy and epidemic.

**The algorithm as matchmaker of dread.** The recommendation engine connecting vulnerable viewers with exploitative content — not through malice but through optimization. The system does not know the viewer is lonely or suggestible; it knows they engage with certain content and serves more. Horror without an antagonist: the optimization function producing outcomes no human designed.

The $KON_SPIRAL dial calibrates PHANTASMATA's engagement with these dynamics. At low settings (0-30), mediation is visible but stable. At mid settings (30-60), the boundary between performer and performance blurs. At high settings (60-100), mediation collapse is total: the performer cannot locate themselves outside the performance, the audience cannot determine whether it is observing or being observed. Screen life horror operates natively at $KON_SPIRAL 50-80.

### B9. The Attention Economy as Horror Engine

**Algorithmic amplification of fear.** Fear generates engagement; engagement drives distribution; distribution amplifies fear content. The algorithm does not distinguish between content that informs and content that terrifies. This is the "curse that spreads" (cf. Ringu) updated: the vector is not a tape but a feed.

**Doom-scrolling as compulsion.** The infinite scroll produces engagement resembling compulsive behavior — no natural stopping point, each item promising the next may be more urgent. This maps to $LYNCH_DRIFT: the long slow approach toward something that never arrives, the corridor that extends as you walk.

**The notification as interrupt.** The attention-capture mechanism that intrudes upon current activity. In horror terms, the knock at the door. The badge persists until acknowledged, accumulating anxiety proportional to unacknowledged notifications.

**Metrics as existential measure.** Follower counts, like counts, engagement rates become existential measures for those whose self-worth depends on them. The horror is the metric's authority: the number determines the self's value, and the self cannot control the number.

**The feed as reality filter.** The algorithmic feed does not show the user reality — it shows the user a version of reality curated for engagement. Two users on the same platform, in the same city, at the same moment, see different feeds. Their realities diverge not because the world differs but because the algorithm's model of each user differs. This produces a form of subjective isolation that is new to the digital age: you cannot know what reality another person is being shown, and they cannot know yours. In horror terms, the haunted house is personalized — each person's screen shows them a different house, and the houses may be more or less dangerous depending on what the algorithm has learned about the viewer's vulnerabilities. This is the ultimate expression of $LYNCH_DRIFT within the digital: the mundane anchor (the feed) is different for every person, and no one can verify their reality against anyone else's because everyone's reality is algorithmically unique.

### B10. Digital Identity Horror: The Post-Authentic Self

**Catfishing:** a false identity exploiting the platform's implicit authentication. The horror is the gap between profile and person.

**Deepfakes:** AI-generated video depicting real people doing things they never did. The epistemological crisis is total: if video evidence can be fabricated, the visual record — screen life cinema's reality claim — is unreliable.

**The profile that outlives its creator:** a dead person's account persists, receives notifications, appears in feeds. The account is a functional ghost. Kon anticipated this in 1997: Perfect Blue's "Mima's Room" website continues speaking in her voice after she ceased to authorize it. By 2024, every social media account is a potential ghost.

**AI-generated profiles:** accounts operated by language models. The platform cannot distinguish human user from convincing simulation, and the simulation performs engagement as effectively as the original. The horror is not malevolence but sufficiency.

For PHANTASMATA, digital identity horror is the domain's deepest connection to "horror as epistemology, not genre decoration." The crisis is not "is there a monster?" but "is this person real?" — and platforms provide no reliable mechanism for answering.

## C) Techniques Inventory

Twenty techniques for screen life and social media horror. Each: name, definition, horror function, examples, PHANTASMATA format affinity.

---

**T01. The Typing Indicator**
*Definition:* The three-dot animation signaling someone is composing a message. It appears, persists, then produces a message or disappears without one. *Horror function:* Appearance creates anticipation; disappearance without a message creates dread through absence — someone intended to communicate and stopped, or was stopped. *Examples:* Unfriended (Laura types, deletes, retypes), Host (medium's messages appear and vanish), TikTok horror using iMessage typing indicators. *Format:* Screen-capture, mock-post.

**T02. The Cursor Reveal**
*Definition:* Cursor movement across a screen highlighting content the viewer might not have noticed. The cursor as pointing finger directing attention to an embedded anomaly. *Horror function:* Reveals what was always there — the viewer was looking at the same screen and did not see the anomaly until the cursor moved. Reproduces the "second look" horror of the photograph you glance at casually then look at again. *Examples:* Searching (cursor pauses on anomalous browser entry), Unfriended (cursor reveals unnoticed message). *Format:* Screen-capture.

**T03. The Browser Tab as Subtext**
*Definition:* Visible but unclicked tabs communicating information the character has sought but is not engaging with. The tab bar as screen life's bookshelf — things kept accessible reveal what someone is thinking. *Horror function:* Tabs create dramatic irony: the viewer sees tabs conversational partners do not. Content (search results for poisons, "how to disappear" guides) provides subtextual counterpoint to spoken statements. *Examples:* Searching, Missing, Unfriended: Dark Web. *Format:* Screen-capture.

**T04. The Notification Interrupt**
*Definition:* A notification intruding upon current activity — the screen's knock at the door. An event the user did not initiate and cannot fully control. *Horror function:* Creates involuntary exposure; content visible to anyone viewing the screen. Notifications from blocked contacts, deleted accounts, or unknown numbers signal boundary violations. *Examples:* Unfriended (messages from blocked Laura), Host, Searching. *Format:* Screen-capture, mock-post.

**T05. The Delete-and-Retype**
*Definition:* A character types a message, deletes it, types a different one. The viewer sees both, witnessing the gap between impulse and presentation. *Horror function:* Reveals digital communication's performative nature — every sent message is the survivor of a selection process, and deleted drafts contain suppressed truths. *Examples:* Unfriended (Blaire's deletions reveal complicity), Searching (David's deleted police messages reveal desperation). *Format:* Screen-capture.

**T06. The Buffering Pause**
*Definition:* Video feed interrupted by buffering — image freezing, pixelating, degrading to compression artifacts while audio cuts or loops. The screen's power outage. *Horror function:* Creates suspense through technological failure: reality continues behind the frozen image, and the distorted face caught mid-expression becomes a mask concealing whatever is currently happening. When the feed resumes, the scene may have changed catastrophically. *Examples:* Unfriended (feeds freeze at death moments), Host (medium's feed buffers and she is gone when it resumes). *Format:* Video-log, screen-capture.

**T07. The Comment Section Chorus**
*Definition:* Visible comment section, chat scroll, or reaction feed as collective voice responding to primary content. The screen's Greek chorus. *Horror function:* Destabilizes interpretive autonomy — multiple simultaneous interpretations (horrified, amused, skeptical, encouraging) normalize, contextualize, or amplify dread. Reminds the viewer that horror is a social event. *Examples:* Deadstream (live chat commentary), Spree (viewers react to murders), World's Fair (YouTube comments on transformation videos). *Format:* Mock-post, screen-capture, video-log.

**T08. The Algorithmic Recommendation**
*Definition:* Algorithmically suggested content reflecting, amplifying, or distorting the user's recent activity. The system's interpretation presented back as mirror. *Horror function:* Produces uncanny recognition of being known by a non-human system. The user searches for something private, and the algorithm serves content reflecting that search — confirming the system has registered the user's interiority. Not surveillance by a person but by a process. *Examples:* Searching (targeted ads reflect search history), Missing (suggestions lead down rabbit holes). *Format:* Screen-capture.

**T09. The Digital Doppelganger**
*Definition:* A digital entity — profile, deepfake, AI persona — replicating a real person's identity within digital space. Occupies the same platform space, posts in their voice, is indistinguishable by platform-native means. *Horror function:* Attacks identity at its most vulnerable: self-representation in a system where identity is performance. If identity is what you post, and someone else posts as you, the distinction is a governance question, not an ontological one. *Examples:* Cam, Perfect Blue, Profile, catfishing narratives. *Format:* Mock-post, screen-capture.

**T10. The Platform-Native Format**
*Definition:* Horror content created within a platform's native format, exploiting affordances and habitual engagement patterns. Indistinguishable, at first encounter, from non-horror content. *Horror function:* Weaponizes habituation. The viewer scrolls past horror using the same gesture for all content; impact depends on the moment of recognition — the double-take, the scroll-back. *Examples:* TikTok "POV:" horror, NoSleep posts, analog horror YouTube uploads. *Format:* Mock-post (primary), all formats.

**T11. The Parasocial Breach**
*Definition:* The moment the one-sided parasocial relationship is violated — the fan's attention becomes visible, the creator's performance is interrupted by evidence of audience presence, or observer/observed boundary collapses. *Horror function:* Converts comfortable distance into uncomfortable proximity. The comfort of asymmetric attention becomes the threat of symmetric surveillance. *Examples:* Deadstream (comment section influences streamer behavior), World's Fair (JLB's attention crosses from observation to intervention), Spree (Kurt demands witness, converting viewership to complicity). *Format:* Mock-post, video-log.

**T12. The Engagement Metric as Horror**
*Definition:* Visible engagement metrics (followers, likes, views, shares) as narrative instruments whose fluctuation drives character behavior. *Horror function:* Metrics externalize social value as a number whose fluctuation produces anxiety proportional to the character's investment. Declining metrics = social death; spiking metrics may demand escalation to sustain. The number determines the self's value, and the self cannot control the number. *Examples:* Spree (view count validates kills), Sissy (follower count as self-worth), Cam (doppelganger's superior metrics). *Format:* Screen-capture, mock-post.

**T13. The Ephemeral Story**
*Definition:* Content in a platform's ephemeral format (Instagram Stories, Snapchat) that disappears after a set period. *Horror function:* Creates urgency (see it before it disappears) and evidential crisis (it existed but is gone, and its former existence cannot be proven). The ghost: a presence that was there and is no longer. *Examples:* Instagram horror accounts posting disturbing ephemeral content, ARGs using stories to time-gate narrative. *Format:* Mock-post.

**T14. The Search History as Character**
*Definition:* A character's search engine history as biographical and psychological document — concerns, fears, knowledge, intentions revealed more directly than dialogue. *Horror function:* The unperformed self: questions asked when no one watches are the truest expression of interiority. A history progressing from "headache remedies" to "how to detect arsenic" narrates a psychological trajectory without dialogue. *Examples:* Searching, Missing, Unfriended: Dark Web. *Format:* Screen-capture.

**T15. The Voice-Note Confession**
*Definition:* An audio message through a messaging app capturing raw, unperformed self-disclosure. More intimate than text (vocal texture, breathing, ambient sound) but more controlled than a call (can be re-recorded). *Horror function:* Intimacy creates presence — breath, tremor, hesitation, room sounds. A voice note from an unknown number, or received after the sender's death, produces horror through a voice that should be absent. *Examples:* Horror ARGs using WhatsApp voice notes, screen life thrillers using voice messages for information too dangerous for text. *Format:* Audio-log, screen-capture.

**T16. The Read Receipt as Surveillance**
*Definition:* The platform's confirmation that a message has been viewed — deployed as evidence of presence, attention, or deliberate non-response. *Horror function:* Converts reading into a visible event. "Read" but not responded to communicates deliberate silence. A read receipt from a dead person's account ("Seen 2:47 AM") signals presence where presence should be impossible. *Examples:* Short-form horror using iMessage read receipts, WhatsApp blue checks, Instagram "Seen" indicators. *Format:* Screen-capture, mock-post.

**T17. The Group Chat Dynamics**
*Definition:* A group messaging thread's social dynamics — who speaks, is silent, leaves, is added, is removed — as narrative container for social horror. *Horror function:* Makes social dynamics visible and permanent. Platform actions (adding, removing, muting) have social meanings visible to all. "X has left the chat" after a disturbing revelation. The group chat as social body whose mutations are narrated by the platform itself. *Examples:* Unfriended (Skype group losing members to death), creepypasta group chat screenshots. *Format:* Screen-capture, mock-post.

**T18. The Abandoned Profile**
*Definition:* A social media profile that has ceased activity but continues to exist — a temporal capsule displaying a person as they were when they stopped. *Horror function:* The digital empty house. Signals departure without explanation — the person may have left, been incarcerated, or died. The profile does not distinguish. The abandoned profile that suddenly shows new activity. The abandoned profile whose photos are used by someone else. *Examples:* World's Fair (Casey's earlier videos as traces), Unfriended (Laura's reactivating profile). *Format:* Mock-post, screen-capture.

**T19. The Screenshot as Evidence**
*Definition:* A static capture of a screen's state deployed as documentary evidence. The digital photograph of what the screen showed. *Horror function:* Claims documentary authority while being trivially fabricable. Evidence that is simultaneously the easiest to forge — epistemologically unstable. The proof that something happened, but proof that is never conclusive. *Examples:* Creepypasta screenshots of disturbing messages, Reddit horror screenshots of anomalous app behavior, ARG clue distribution. *Format:* Screen-capture, mock-post.

**T20. The Multi-Feed Scan**
*Definition:* Simultaneous display of multiple video feeds (Zoom grid, security array, multi-cam stream) requiring distributed attention. *Horror function:* Creates anxiety of incomplete attention. The viewer cannot watch all feeds simultaneously; horror can occur in any feed at any moment. Certainty that something is happening in the periphery, combined with inability to attend to everything at once. *Examples:* Host (Zoom grid), Unfriended: Dark Web (security cameras), Deadstream (multiple angles). *Format:* Video-log, screen-capture.

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### Native Territory Declaration

This domain is PHANTASMATA's native habitat. All five output formats are screen-mediated: video-log (screen recording or feed viewed through a screen), screen-capture (the screen documenting itself), audio-log (a file played through a device), text-fragment (a document on a screen), mock-post (a social artifact existing only on a screen). Screen life and social media horror are not source domains from which PHANTASMATA borrows. They are the formal language in which PHANTASMATA speaks. The techniques in Section C are native grammar, not external references.

### Dial Settings for This Domain

**$ARGENTO_GEL: 0-20 (typically 5-10).** The screen's native aesthetic is not chromatic. Desktop interfaces, messaging apps, and social platforms are designed for readability, not visual drama. Bold saturation is antithetical to the screen's language — a screen-capture drenched in red gel reads as a filter effect, not Argento-derived horror. Exception: platform-specific color signals (red notification badge, green online indicator, blue verification checkmark) carry emotional weight within the interface's own system. Their manipulation (a red badge that will not clear, a green indicator on a dead person's account) is the screen-appropriate color-as-weapon.

**$LYNCH_DRIFT: 20-55.** Lynch's register is available but not dominant. Screen life typically maintains the mundane anchor and introduces dream logic selectively: the tab that should not exist, the message from an impossible sender, the search result answering a question the user did not ask. At higher settings (45-55), the interface begins to behave as dream space — the screen showing something the user did not navigate to, the desktop rearranging itself, the cursor moving without input.

**$KON_SPIRAL: 60-100 (primary dial).** This domain is $KON_SPIRAL territory. Mediation collapse is the screen life form's defining condition. Kon's vocabulary — the performance that subsumes the performer, the image that replaces the source, the observer whose observation contaminates the observed — is the precise vocabulary of screen life and social media horror. High settings (80-100) produce outputs where the boundary between artifact and platform is deliberately thin.

### Output Format Connections

**Video-Log:** Inherits from Host (recorded video call), Deadstream (livestream archive), Spree (dashboard-cam stream), Unfriended (screen-recorded group call). In this domain, the video-log is always a recording of a recording — a capture of a screen displaying a video feed. This double mediation is the format's distinctive texture: the viewer watches a recording of someone watching a screen, and the layers of mediation produce a specific distance that is paradoxically more intimate than direct camera footage, because the viewer sees not just what the camera sees but what the user chooses to look at on their screen.

Key properties: The video call grid as multi-character composition. The chat overlay as textual counterpoint to visual content. The recording timestamp as temporal anchor. The cursor's movement as the user's attention. The notification's intrusion as narrative event. The buffer and freeze as temporal rupture. Duration that respects platform conventions — a Zoom recording runs the length of the call, not the length of a film. Irregular audio quality: the thin, compressed quality of a video call versus the richer quality of a locally recorded voiceover, and the difference between them as a diegetic signal of who is local and who is remote.

**Screen-Capture:** This domain's primary format. Inherits from Searching (desktop as investigative space), Unfriended: Dark Web (desktop as crime scene). The screen documenting itself. Key properties: screenshot timestamp as anchor, multiple visible applications as layered information, cursor as presence, notification panel as event queue, search bar as thought, tab bar as psychological profile, battery/signal as ambient tension.

**Audio-Log:** Inherits from voice notes (T15), the audio component of calls when video cuts out. Key properties: platform audio compression as texture, notification sounds as punctuation, typing as background rhythm, ambient room sound through laptop microphone.

**Text-Fragment:** Inherits from messaging threads (WhatsApp, iMessage, Discord), email chains, notes left on recovered devices. Key properties: platform-specific formatting (blue vs. green bubbles, role-colored usernames, check marks), timestamps, read receipts, editing indicators, deletion traces.

**Mock-Post:** This domain's most native format — the format that most directly inhabits the territory mapped in this brief. The mock-post IS a social media horror artifact: a piece of content that mimics the format of a genuine platform post and circulates (or could circulate) on the same platform it depicts. The mock-post is not a representation of social media; it is social media — the same format, the same distribution channel, the same engagement mechanics.

Key properties: Total platform fidelity — the mock-post must be structurally and visually indistinguishable from a genuine post on the mimicked platform. Engagement signals (likes, comments, shares, views) as part of the text: the numbers are not decorative but narrative (a post with 2 likes tells a different story than a post with 2 million views — the former is intimate, unseen, possibly addressed to no one; the latter is public, amplified, impossible to retract). The profile behind the post (username, avatar, bio, follower count) as character — the profile communicates identity before the content communicates message. The timestamp as temporal anchor. The comment section as social context — the comments frame the post's reception, and the nature of that reception (alarm, mockery, indifference, engagement) shapes the viewer's interpretation. The mock-post is designed to be encountered in a feed, scrolled past, double-taken, returned to — it exploits the browsing mode of social media consumption by embedding horror in the casual scroll.

### Cross-Domain Connections

**To Brief 01 (Found Footage):** Screen life is found footage's direct evolutionary descendant. The trajectory from Cannibal Holocaust's found reels to Blair Witch's found tapes to Unfriended's found screen recording is continuous. The epistemic contract is the same (this document was recovered, not authored for you); the medium has shifted from film to tape to interface.

**To Brief 02 (Digital Paranoia):** This brief's social media horror extends Brief 02's internet-native horror ecosystem. Brief 02 mapped the internet as horror production environment; this brief maps the screen as formal constraint and the platform as narrative engine. The techniques are complementary — collaborative authorship (Brief 02) combines with interface mechanics (this brief) for the full digital horror vocabulary.

**To Anchor Director Reports:** Kon's films anticipate every major dynamic of this domain with a precision that borders on prophecy. Perfect Blue (1997) anticipates the digital doppelganger (Cam), the parasocial breach (Deadstream), and the website-as-ghost (abandoned profiles); Millennium Actress anticipates the performance that subsumes the performer (Sissy, influencer horror broadly); Paprika anticipates the mediation layer that becomes more real than reality (I Saw the TV Glow); Paranoia Agent anticipates the collectively authored threat that spreads through a network (viral horror, Slender Man). Kon is the bridge between cinematic horror and platform horror, and the $KON_SPIRAL dial is the instrument that calibrates PHANTASMATA's position on that bridge.

Lynch's temporal and spatial distortions (the corridor that should not exist, the room that has changed since you last entered it) map onto the digital interface's potential for spatial impossibility (the tab that was not there, the file that has moved, the desktop that has rearranged itself). Lynch's identity blur (Fred Madison becoming Pete Dayton in Lost Highway) is the cinematic ancestor of the digital doppelganger and the profile that acts autonomously. At higher $LYNCH_DRIFT settings, screen life artifacts begin to behave like Lynchian spaces — familiar but wrong, navigable but disorienting, mundane in their components but uncanny in their arrangement.

Argento's contribution is minimal but precise: surface-as-weapon. The screen's surface (its brightness, its color palette, its visual rhythm) can be deployed aggressively, and the viewer's eyes — habituated to a platform's neutral aesthetic — are vulnerable to chromatic disruption. The rare, targeted use of color in an otherwise platform-neutral screen-capture (a red notification badge that will not clear, a video feed whose white balance is catastrophically wrong, a filter that the user did not apply) is the screen-appropriate expression of Argento's color-as-horror. The restraint is the point: in a domain where $ARGENTO_GEL is typically 0-10, a spike to 30 or 40 is not decorative but violent — a chromatic intrusion into a space that the viewer expects to be visually neutral.

### Ethical Design Parameters

Screen life and social media horror pose specific ethical challenges because PHANTASMATA outputs circulate on the same platforms they depict. A mock-post on Instagram is not representation of Instagram horror — it IS Instagram horror, in the same feed as genuine content.

**1. No impersonation of real persons.** Mock-posts must not use real persons' names, photographs, or accounts. The digital doppelganger (T09) applies exclusively to fictional personas.

**2. No mimicry of real platform emergency systems.** Outputs must not replicate platform emergency features (Safety Check, crisis alerts, Amber Alerts) in ways that could cause genuine alarm.

**3. Discoverable fictionality at one remove.** Mock-posts need not signal fictionality within their own frame, but a viewer who investigates the source must be able to discover fictional status within reasonable effort. The PHANTASMATA account's bio or linked page must make the project's nature accessible.

**4. No exploitation of real platform crises.** Outputs must not incorporate real data breaches, doxxing events, or harassment campaigns as material.

**5. The replaceability principle.** Mock-posts must not target specific real communities with content designed to be mistaken for genuine threats.

**6. Platform-appropriate content warnings.** When PHANTASMATA outputs are distributed on platforms that support content warnings (Twitter/X content warnings, Instagram sensitive content screens, YouTube age restrictions), those warnings should be used. The formal contract is "audience uncertainty about the status of this content" — not "audience exposure to unwanted content without consent." The content warning does not destroy the horror; it frames it as an experience the viewer opts into, which is the ethical minimum for content that operates in shared digital spaces.

These parameters channel PHANTASMATA's capacity toward horror that destabilizes the viewer's epistemological relationship to digital interfaces — not horror that harms specific persons through deception. The distinction is between art that makes you distrust the screen and fraud that makes you distrust the artist. PHANTASMATA operates in the territory between these two poles, and the ethical parameters define the boundary that separates productive destabilization from harmful deception. The boundary is not always sharp, and navigating it requires ongoing judgment — but the parameters provide the criteria for that judgment.
