## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. Ingmar Bergman: The Silent Void
*   **The Engine:** The Absence of God/Self. Horror is not an external threat but the silence that follows an internal plea (*Persona*, *Hour of the Wolf*, *Cries and Whispers*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *The Extreme Close-up:* Faces so close they merge or dissolve into one another.
    *   *Clock Imagery:* The oppressive ticking of time without meaning.
    *   *The Persona:* Masks, mirrors, and the instability of the face.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Stasis. Characters are trapped in a single location (an island, a house) where their identities begin to bleed into each other.
*   **Epistemology:** *Language is a Barrier.* We cannot truly know another person; we can only know the mask they show us.

### B. Roman Polanski: The Claustrophobic Paranoia
*   **The Engine:** The Apartment Trilogy. The environment is an accomplice to the protagonist's mental collapse (*Repulsion*, *Rosemary's Baby*, *The Tenant*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *Expanding Architecture:* Rooms that grow larger or corridors that stretch as madness takes hold.
    *   *The Gaze from the Walls:* Neighbors, strangers, or objects watching through cracks and keyholes.
    *   *The Inanimate as Alive:* Walls that sweat, hands that reach from wallpaper.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Encroachment. A private space is systematically invaded by external forces (or the protagonist's perception of them).
*   **Epistemology:** *Reality is a Consensus.* If everyone else says you are crazy, the world changes to match their truth.

### C. Kaneto Shindo / Japanese Ghost Stories: The Grudge of the Earth
*   **The Engine:** Onryō (Vengeful Spirits). Horror is a physical weight left behind by trauma and injustice (*Onibaba*, *Kuroneko*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *Tall Grass/Nature:* The environment as a hiding place for the dead.
    *   *The Mask:* The frozen expression of the spirit (Hannya).
    *   *The Repetition:* The spirit bound to a single location or act.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Haunting. The past does not stay past; it physically occupies the present.
*   **Epistemology:** *History is a Wound.* The dead have more agency than the living.

### D. German Expressionism: The Geometric Soul
*   **The Engine:** Subjective Reality. The set design reflects the protagonist's internal emotional state (*The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*, *Nosferatu*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *Jagged Shadows:* Unnatural, painted-on shadows.
    *   *Impossible Angles:* Doors and windows that tilt at 45-degree angles.
    *   *The Silhouette:* The simplification of the human form into a sharp, threatening shape.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Nightmare. The world itself is a dream-space governed by the logic of fear.
*   **Epistemology:** *Objectivity is a Myth.* The world only looks "normal" when you are "sane."

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE FRAGMENTED SELF PROTOCOL"

**Axiom:** Your reflection is a separate entity.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Fracture:** The protagonist experiences a trauma or an epistemic shock (Ring 0/1).
2.  **The Projection:** The protagonist's internal dread manifests as an external anomaly (The "Polanski" Wall).
3.  **The Merging:** The protagonist encounters their "Double" (The "Bergman" Persona).
4.  **The Erasure:** The protagonist is replaced by the projection. The "Real" self is silenced.

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Video-Logs:** Use the "Bergman" close-up to make the speaker's face feel like it's shifting between frames.
*   **Ring 2 (City of Gels):** Use "Expressionist" geometry—shadows that point toward the source of light rather than away from it.
*   **Ring 3 (Deep Drift):** Use "Shindo" repetition—the same 10-second video clip appearing in every folder on a user's computer.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Fragment: "The Two-Way"
*Context: A user is recording a 'Get Ready with Me' video in front of a bathroom mirror.*

The user is applying makeup. The lighting is high-saturation VIOLET ($ARGENTO bonus).
The user smiles at the mirror. 
The reflection does not smile back. It continues to apply makeup, but with clinical, robotic precision.
The user stops. They touch their cheek.
The reflection touches its *opposite* cheek. 
The user realizes the reflection is not mirroring; it is **performing**.
The user tries to leave the room. The door is now painted onto the wall (Expressionist geometry).
The reflection turns to look at the "Real" user.
The reflection says: "You missed a spot."
The "Real" user's face begins to crack like porcelain.

---

## Part 5: Refinement (Step 17)

*Critique:* The "Real" user's face cracking is too "CGI."
*Refinement:* Instead of cracking, have the "Real" user lose the ability to move their mouth. Their voice begins to come from the reflection's mouth instead.
*Epistemology:* The voice (identity) has migrated to the image ($KON).

## Part 6: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** High $KON_SPIRAL (Mediation) + High $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS.
*   **Primary Effect:** Identity Vertigo.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes the "Fragmented Self" as the primary hazard of Week 7.
