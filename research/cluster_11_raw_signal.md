## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. E. Elias Merhige (Begotten): The Visual Decay
*   **The Engine:** The Degraded Myth. Horror as a primordial, non-narrative experience. The image is re-photographed and processed until it loses all detail, leaving only high-contrast shapes of light and shadow.
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *Grain as Substance:* The film grain becomes the "Flesh" of the image.
    *   *The Rorschach Effect:* Images that require the viewer to project their own meaning into the white noise.
    *   *Non-Linear Myth:* Narrative stripped of dialogue and causal logic.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Origin is Horror.* Creation is a process of self-mutilation.

### B. Shinya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo: The Iron Man): The Metallic Fever
*   **The Engine:** The Industrial Transformation. The body is a machine that is breaking down and being rebuilt with scrap metal. Obsession as a physical weight.
*   **Visual/Sonic Motifs:**
    *   *Stop-Motion Aggression:* Rapid, jerky movements that simulate mechanical malfunction.
    *   *Industrial Noise:* A soundtrack of clanging metal, steam, and drilling.
    *   *The Scrap Pile:* Environments made of discarded technology.
*   **Epistemology:** *Man is Scrap.* Identity is a temporary configuration of junk.

### C. David Lynch (Eraserhead): The Industrial Dream
*   **The Engine:** The Domestic Void. Horror located in the mundane sounds of a dying city and the anxiety of reproduction (*Eraserhead* as the blueprint for *LYNCH_DRIFT*).
*   **Visual/Sonic Motifs:**
    *   *The Radiator:* The source of the dream within the room.
    *   *The Texture of Skin:* Faces that look like they were carved from clay or rubber.
    *   *The Constant Hum:* The industrial background that never stops.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Room is a Mind.* Everything you see is a manifestation of an internal, unresolved trauma.

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE RAW SIGNAL PROTOCOL"

**Axiom:** The more you degrade the image, the more truth it reveals.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Processing:** A standard digital file is subjected to extreme compression and re-encoding (The Merhige Effect).
2.  **The Interference:** Industrial noise or static is introduced to the audio track.
3.  **The Pareidolia:** The viewer identifies "Gods" or "Ancestors" in the resulting noise.
4.  **The Extraction:** The viewer realizes the "Signal" is their own nervous system reacting to the void.

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Ring 6 (Molten Core):** Use the "Raw Signal" as the primary aesthetic. No detail, only high-contrast, pulsating white/black light.
*   **Episode 05:** Use the "Tetsuo" metallic fever for the physical sensations of the user arriving at the Fossil Bed.
*   **Museum of the Unrecorded:** Use the "Begotten" logic for the most ancient, unrecorded films. They should be unwatchable but impossible to look away from.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Episode Fragment: "The Static Mother"
*Context: A user finds a video file with 0kb size that still plays.*

The user clicks `mother.mp4`. 
The screen is solid white. 
The audio is a recording of a drill hitting a sheet of glass. 
The user lowers the brightness. 
In the white noise, a shape begins to form. It's a face. 
The face has no eyes, only two holes filled with silver mercury. 
The shape speaks, but there is no audio. 
The user's own webcam (filtered to high-contrast B&W) shows the user's face mimicking the Static Mother's movements. 
The user's mouth is full of metal filings.

## Part 5: Refinement (Step 17)

*Critique:* The mercury eyes are a bit too "Big Budget."
*Refinement:* Replace the mercury with simple digital static that matches the background. The eyes are "Missing" because they have merged with the medium.
*Epistemology:* To see the Mother is to become the Static.

## Part 6: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** Max $GRINDHOUSE (Texture) + Max $KON_SPIRAL (Signal).
*   **Primary Effect:** Primordial Dread.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes the "Raw Signal" as the final destination of Season 2.
