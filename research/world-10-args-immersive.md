## A) Topic Definition and Scope

Every other brief in this series examines horror that is watched, read, or listened to. This brief examines horror that is *done*. The distinction is not stylistic but ontological: participatory horror places the audience inside the horror system, not as a spectator processing aesthetic signals but as an agent whose choices, movements, and interpretive acts constitute the horror event itself. The audience does not watch someone enter the dark room. The audience enters the dark room. The audience does not read about a mysterious phone call. The audience's phone rings.

This brief consolidates two research streams that share a common formal proposition — that the boundary between fiction and the audience's lived reality can be made porous, and that the porosity itself is the primary source of dread. The first stream is *alternate reality games and participatory online horror* (The Beast, I Love Bees, Year Zero, Marble Hornets, EverymanHYBRID, TribeTwelve, Ben Drowned, The Sun Vanished, Daisy Brown, Petscop, This House Has People In It). The second is *immersive theater, horror attractions, and experience design* (Sleep No More, Then She Fell, The Drowned Man, Blackout, McKamey Manor, Delusion, escape rooms, commercial haunted attractions, interactive digital horror). These streams differ in their medium — the first operates through screens, the second through physical space — but converge on a single formal problem: *how to make the audience uncertain whether they are inside a fiction or inside reality*.

For PHANTASMATA, this domain is not one topic among ten. It is the project's operational model. PHANTASMATA's five output formats — video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post — are designed to exist AS IF they are real artifacts found in the world. The project's creative mandate specifies "audience uncertainty is the design intent." The output is not content to be consumed within a marked fictional frame (a cinema screen, a book cover, a television schedule). The output is content designed to be *encountered* — scrolled past in a feed, discovered on a platform, shared without context. Every PHANTASMATA artifact is, in the language of ARG design, a *rabbit hole* — an object whose formal properties invite investigation, whose ontological status is ambiguous, whose purpose is to make the encountering audience pause and ask: *is this real?*

The question "is this real?" is the formal engine that connects a 2001 Microsoft promotional campaign (The Beast), a 2009 YouTube horror series (Marble Hornets), a 2011 immersive theater production in a Chelsea hotel (Sleep No More), a 2017 YouTube series about a girl and her monster (Daisy Brown), and a 2018 Twitter thread about an apocalyptic event (The Sun Vanished). These works differ in budget, platform, genre, and ambition. They share a single structural commitment: the fiction does not announce itself as fiction. The audience must determine, through investigation, engagement, or bodily experience, where the reality ends and the fiction begins — or whether that determination is possible at all.

This domain also contains PHANTASMATA's most urgent ethical territory. Participatory horror can produce genuine harm — the 2014 Waukesha stabbing is the extreme instance. Where is the line between productive uncertainty and destructive deception? Sleep No More manages this through ritual, commercial haunts through waivers and safe words, ARGs through community understanding. PHANTASMATA must articulate its own ethical framework — proposed in this brief's final section.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What are the formal mechanisms by which ARGs collapse the boundary between game and reality, and how have these mechanisms evolved from The Beast (2001) through contemporary horror ARGs?
2. How do platform-native horror series (Marble Hornets, Daisy Brown, The Sun Vanished) use the affordances of their host platforms — upload dates, subscriber counts, comment sections, notification systems — as narrative elements, and what does this platform-as-narrative strategy mean for PHANTASMATA's multi-format output?
3. What are the specific techniques by which immersive theater (Sleep No More, Then She Fell) produces horror through the audience's physical presence, bodily vulnerability, and enforced participation — and how do these embodied techniques translate into the disembodied, screen-mediated formats PHANTASMATA employs?
4. How do extreme haunted attractions (McKamey Manor, Blackout) and interactive horror (Bandersnatch, The Dark Pictures Anthology) negotiate the consent boundary — the line beyond which participatory horror becomes coercion — and what ethical principles does this negotiation establish for PHANTASMATA?
5. What is the formal relationship between the ARG's "puppet master" (the hidden author who orchestrates the experience) and PHANTASMATA's authorial position — and how does PHANTASMATA manage the tension between authored design intent and audience-constructed meaning?
6. How do the three director dials ($ARGENTO_GEL, $LYNCH_DRIFT, $KON_SPIRAL) map onto participatory horror design, and which configurations produce the most effective PHANTASMATA outputs?
7. What is the ethical distinction between "audience uncertainty" (PHANTASMATA's stated design intent) and "audience deception" (the manipulation that participatory horror can enable), and how is this distinction operationalized in production practice?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. Alternate Reality Games: The Architecture of Dissolved Boundaries

#### The Beast and the TINAG Principle

The history of participatory horror begins with a promotional campaign for a Spielberg film nobody remembers as a film. *A.I. Artificial Intelligence* (2001) was accompanied by an alternate reality game — "The Beast" — designed by Jordan Weisman and Elan Lee at Microsoft. The entry point was a trailer credit: "Jeanine Salla, Sentient Machine Therapist." Players who searched this name found fictional websites linking to other websites, phone numbers connecting to voicemail messages, clues leading to emails and media artifacts — a multi-platform murder mystery distributed across hundreds of websites, phone lines, and physical media over three months.

The Beast established the foundational design principle of all subsequent ARGs: TINAG — This Is Not A Game. The game never acknowledges that it is a game. No "start screen," no rules, no formal boundary between game world and real world. The websites look like real websites. The phone numbers are real phone numbers. The fiction occupies the same infrastructure as reality and refuses to mark itself as fiction. The player must determine, through investigation, that a Beast website belongs to a game rather than to reality. This determination is the game's first puzzle and its most fundamental proposition: *the world you live in and the world of the game are the same world, and the boundary between them is a problem for you to solve, not a frame for us to provide*.

For PHANTASMATA, the TINAG principle is both foundational and insufficient. Foundational because PHANTASMATA's outputs occupy the same platforms as non-fictional content without marking themselves as fiction. Insufficient because PHANTASMATA's ethical framework (Section D) requires that the fiction eventually *become* distinguishable — that uncertainty is productive and temporary rather than permanent and manipulative.

#### I Love Bees and the Real World as Game Board

42 Entertainment's *I Love Bees* (2004), designed to promote *Halo 2*, extended the ARG form from the internet into physical space. The game's central mechanic was elegant: coordinates and times appeared on a mysterious website, and players who traveled to the corresponding real-world locations — public payphones — at the specified times received incoming calls that played audio fragments of a science-fiction narrative. The calls were automated but responsive: players had to answer specific questions to unlock the next segment.

The innovation was the transformation of real physical space into game space. A player at a payphone in Amarillo, Texas, receiving a call from a fictional AI, is simultaneously in the real world and the game's narrative. The payphone — a real object serving a real function — is simultaneously infrastructure and set piece. The game does not build its own space but occupies the space that already exists.

For PHANTASMATA, *I Love Bees* demonstrates *infrastructural parasitism*: fiction that attaches itself to existing channels, exploiting their credibility and embeddedness in daily life. PHANTASMATA artifacts do not create their own platforms; they appear on existing platforms where the audience already lives, parasitizing the infrastructure's credibility.

#### Year Zero: The ARG as Total Artwork

Trent Reznor and 42 Entertainment's *Year Zero* (2007) represents the ARG form's most ambitious integration of participatory fiction with art practice. The project, ostensibly a Nine Inch Nails album, was actually a multi-platform speculative fiction about a dystopian near-future America. The entry points were physical: USB drives containing unreleased music tracks were hidden in concert venue bathrooms in European cities. Fans who found the drives discovered not only new songs but embedded URLs leading to websites from the fictional future — government propaganda sites, resistance network pages, corporate communications. Phone numbers printed on merchandise connected to recorded messages from characters. Concert events included staged "SWAT raids" that interrupted performances.

Year Zero's formal innovation is the integration of ARG mechanics with art-object production. The album is simultaneously a commercial release and a game artifact. Songs function as both aesthetic objects and narrative documents. The packaging contains thermal-sensitive ink revealing hidden images when warmed. The CD installs files redirecting browsers to game websites. Every element of a mass-distributed cultural product is also a game component. The boundary between "buying an album" and "entering a game" is unmarked.

For PHANTASMATA, Year Zero demonstrates *dual-register artifacts*: objects that function simultaneously as aesthetic products and participatory game elements. A PHANTASMATA video-log is simultaneously a creative work and a game element — containing details that reward investigation, connecting to other artifacts, implying a larger reality. The experience's power depends on the impossibility of separating these two registers.

### B2. Horror ARGs: The YouTube Haunting

#### Marble Hornets: The Definitive Horror ARG

Troy Wagner and Joseph DeLage's *Marble Hornets* (2009-2014) is the work that demonstrated, irrevocably, that the ARG form could be a horror medium of extraordinary power. The project was not technically an ARG — its creators described it as an "internet series" — but it deployed ARG principles (multi-platform narrative, platform-native formatting, audience investigation, the TINAG aesthetic) within a horror framework that transformed the YouTube platform into a haunted medium.

The structure was precise. A primary YouTube channel ("Marble Hornets") hosted 87 numbered "entries" — video clips presented as footage recovered by the character Jay, who is investigating mysterious tapes shot by his friend Alex for an abandoned student film project. The tapes show Alex's increasing paranoia, strange audio/video distortions, and the appearance of a tall, faceless figure (the Operator, derived from the Slender Man mythology). A secondary YouTube channel ("totheark") uploaded cryptic response videos — short, heavily distorted clips with encoded messages — apparently from an unknown figure monitoring Jay's investigation. Twitter accounts for the characters posted in real-time, maintaining the fiction between video uploads. The entry numbering included gaps (entries were not consecutively numbered), implying missing footage — footage the audience could not access but that existed within the fictional world.

Marble Hornets' formal innovations are specific and extractable.

First, *platform-native serialization*. Each entry was uploaded to YouTube as a discrete video, with the same metadata formatting (title, description, upload date) as any amateur upload. The series exploited YouTube's native affordances: the upload date created a real-time chronology (audiences waited days or weeks between entries, experiencing the narrative's temporal gaps as their own temporal experience); the subscriber count created a visible community (you could see how many others were watching); the comment section became an analytical space where audiences debated interpretations, spotted details, decoded totheark's messages, and constructed theories. The comment section was not supplementary to the narrative — it was where the narrative's meaning was collectively produced.

Second, *the response channel as antagonist*. The totheark channel created a second narrative voice — hostile, cryptic, operating according to its own logic — that commented on, contradicted, and threatened the primary narrative. The audience's task was not simply to watch Jay's investigation but to triangulate between two unreliable sources, neither of which acknowledged the other's existence on a formal level. The two-channel structure transformed YouTube from a video hosting service into a contested narrative space — a space where two incompatible accounts of reality coexisted on the same platform, and the audience's interpretive labor was required to determine which, if either, was authoritative.

Third, *the Operator as formal device*. The Operator (the faceless figure) is never explained. No lore dump, no backstory, no mythology scene. The entity exists purely as a visual and audio disturbance: frames distort when it is near, audio tears, video artifacts multiply. The audience knows the Operator from its *effects* on the medium, not from its narrative characterization. It is an entity that manifests as media corruption — as if the act of recording it damages the recording technology. This makes the Operator a fundamentally *formal* monster: its horror is inseparable from the medium through which it is perceived. Remove the camera, and there is nothing to fear. But the camera cannot be removed, because the camera is the medium through which the narrative exists. The Operator haunts the form, not the story.

Fourth, *the extended timeline as experiential horror*. Marble Hornets ran for five years. Audiences who followed the series from its first entry experienced its horror not as a discrete aesthetic event (a film screening, a novel's reading) but as an ongoing condition of their media consumption. Checking YouTube meant potentially encountering a new entry. Checking Twitter meant potentially encountering Jay's latest anxious message. The horror was temporally diffused — not concentrated into a two-hour film but distributed across years of intermittent exposure. This temporal distribution maps the way real anxiety works: not a single terrifying event but a persistent, low-grade dread punctuated by acute spikes.

For PHANTASMATA, Marble Hornets is the single most important precedent. It demonstrates that platform affordances (upload dates, comment sections, subscriber counts) are not incidental but constitutive — the materials from which the horror experience is built. And it demonstrates that the $FOUND_FOOTAGE axis achieves maximum expression not in cinema but in platform-native horror, where the recording and display medium is already the audience's daily environment.

#### EverymanHYBRID: Breaking the Fourth Wall of the Fourth Wall

The HABIT collective's *EverymanHYBRID* (2010-2018) took Marble Hornets' platform-native approach and escalated it into a form of participatory horror that deliberately erased the line between the series and the audience's physical reality. Beginning as a seemingly innocent fitness vlog that gradually revealed Slender Man-adjacent horror elements, the series expanded to include: live Ustream broadcasts where audiences could interact with characters in real-time; Twitter and Tumblr accounts that responded to individual fan messages in character; and most radically, physical packages mailed to audience members' home addresses containing in-universe artifacts — letters, photographs, small objects. The audience members who received these packages had provided their addresses voluntarily, through in-character interactions, but the arrival of a fictional artifact at a real home address is a threshold-crossing event that no screen-based horror can replicate.

EverymanHYBRID's formal innovation is *real-world bleed*: the deliberate extension of fiction into the audience's physical space. A video can be closed. A package on your doorstep cannot be un-received. It is *there*, with the same material presence as any other object, contaminating physical reality with fiction.

The live broadcasts introduced *real-time collective decision-making under horror conditions*. Characters faced crises and asked the audience for guidance. The chat erupted with competing instructions. The audience experienced horror not as observers but as participants whose choices had narrative consequences — horror as collective action problem.

#### TribeTwelve, Daisy Brown, and the Comment Section as Narrative Space

Adam Rosner's *TribeTwelve* (2010-2021) developed the longest-running horror ARG mythology, incorporating real-world dead drops, coded messages in video descriptions, and a narrative complexity that demanded wiki-level documentation from its audience. But its most significant formal contribution is the systematic use of *the comment section as narrative space*. Characters responded to audience comments in character. Plot information was revealed in comment replies that were visible only to those who scrolled below the video. The comment section — typically a space of audience reaction — became a space of narrative production. To follow TribeTwelve fully, you had to read the comments, because the comments were part of the story.

*Daisy Brown* (YouTube, 2017-2018), created by a young woman who never publicly revealed her identity during the series' run, presented the story of a girl named Daisy caring for a rapidly growing, increasingly dangerous creature named Alan in her home. The series' innovation was *intimacy as horror vector*: Daisy's videos had the production quality and emotional register of a genuine personal vlog — she showed craft projects, talked to the camera with unaffected warmth, introduced Alan as one would introduce a pet. The horror crept in through Alan's growth (he became larger, more demanding, more threatening) and through details visible in the frame that Daisy herself did not acknowledge — stains, damage, strange sounds. The comment section became a space of collective concern: audiences posted warnings, advice, and expressions of worry *as if Daisy were real*. The series' power depended entirely on the audience's willingness to engage with Daisy as a person, and that engagement was facilitated by the platform's native affordances — the comment section's social function (expressing concern for creators) was repurposed as a horror mechanism (expressing concern for a character whose danger is real within the fiction's frame).

*The Sun Vanished* (Twitter, 2018-present) deployed the Twitter thread as a slow-reveal horror format. An account began posting that the sun had not risen, that strange lights were visible in the sky, that something was hunting people who went outside. The tweets used Twitter's native formatting — short, fragmented, urgent, with embedded photos and video clips — to create a horror narrative that was formally indistinguishable from a real person live-tweeting a crisis. The thread format — a chronological sequence of short posts, each adding a fragment to an evolving situation — is structurally identical to how real emergencies are documented on Twitter. The horror is format-perfect: if the sun actually vanished, this is what the Twitter documentation would look like.

For PHANTASMATA, these works demonstrate the principle of *format fidelity as horror mechanism*. The closer the fiction adheres to the formal conventions of genuine platform content — personal vlogs, comment section interactions, crisis threads — the more effectively it exploits the platform's credibility. Daisy Brown worked not because of elaborate production but because it was *indistinguishable from a real vlog*. The Sun Vanished worked not because of sophisticated narrative but because it was *indistinguishable from a real crisis thread*. Format fidelity is the participatory-horror equivalent of found footage's degraded-image authentication: the impersonation of a nonfiction medium's conventions is the technique that produces the audience's uncertainty about ontological status.

#### The Puzzle-Box Narratives: Petscop, This House Has People In It, The Wyoming Incident

A distinct lineage of internet horror operates not through real-time audience interaction but through the creation of dense, self-contained artifacts that reward obsessive analysis. These works do not invite participation in the conventional ARG sense (no one receives packages, no characters respond to comments). They invite investigation: close reading, frame-by-frame analysis, cross-referencing, theory construction. The audience participates not by entering the fiction but by subjecting the fiction to forensic scrutiny.

*Petscop* (YouTube, 2017-2019), created by Tony Domenico, presents screen recordings of a fictional PlayStation game called "Petscop" — a seemingly innocent pet-collection game that contains a hidden layer of disturbing content involving child abuse, disappearances, and reality-distorting mechanics. The videos are narrated by a player named Paul, whose commentary shifts from curious to disturbed to desperate over the series' 24 episodes. The game footage is meticulously fabricated — every screen, every animation, every interface element is purpose-built to sustain the fiction that this is a real game being documented. But the horror is not in the game's content alone; it is in the *density of embedded detail*. Frame-by-frame analysis reveals hidden text, coded messages, visual references to real events, and internal contradictions that resist single-reading comprehension. Petscop is designed to be watched once for horror and rewatched indefinitely for analysis.

Alan Resnick's *This House Has People In It* (Adult Swim, 2016) presents what appears to be security camera footage of a suburban family whose daily routine degenerates into inexplicable crisis — a daughter sinks into the kitchen floor while the family panics around her. The broadcast is disturbing but comprehensible as absurdist horror. However, Adult Swim simultaneously published a companion website (abfortiori.com) containing thousands of pages of supplementary material — internal corporate documents, surveillance logs, employee communications, medical records, video files — that expand the fiction into a vast, paranoid narrative about a company that monitors families through hidden cameras. The broadcast is the tip; the website is the iceberg. The audience who watches only the broadcast experiences discomfort. The audience who investigates the website experiences vertigo — the dread of a system too large to comprehend, too detailed to be accidental, too consistent to be meaningless.

*The Wyoming Incident* (various platforms, 2006-2008) presented what appeared to be a hijacked television broadcast — a signal intrusion overriding regular programming with disturbing images of distorted faces and text reading "YOU ARE ILL. YOU WILL FEEL BETTER. YOU ARE NOT WELL." The format exploited the real history of television signal intrusions (the Max Headroom incident of 1987) and the public's genuine unease about unauthorized broadcast access. The Wyoming Incident was a fiction, but it was formatted as a documentary record of a real event, and the ambiguity was sustained by the absence of any frame identifying it as fiction and by its distribution through channels (early YouTube, forum posts) where genuine anomalous footage circulated.

For PHANTASMATA, these puzzle-box narratives demonstrate the principle of *depth as horror*: the artifact whose surface produces one level of dread and whose investigated depth produces another, more sustained level. A PHANTASMATA video-log that is unsettling on first viewing but that, upon investigation, reveals details (metadata inconsistencies, background elements, audio artifacts) that imply a larger, more disturbing reality — this is the Petscop/This House Has People In It model applied to PHANTASMATA's output formats.

### B3. Immersive Theater: The Body in the Horror Space

#### Sleep No More: The Audience as Voyeur-Intruder

Punchdrunk's *Sleep No More* (2011-2024, McKittrick Hotel, New York) is the defining work of immersive theater and the most sustained experiment in participatory horror that the theatrical world has produced. The production occupied a five-story warehouse in Chelsea transformed into the "McKittrick Hotel" — approximately 100 rooms across six floors, each meticulously designed as a distinct environment (a ballroom, a hospital ward, a taxidermy shop, a graveyard, a candy shop, bedrooms, offices, corridors). The narrative source is *Macbeth* filtered through Hitchcock — the murders, the ambition, the guilt, the madness — but the narrative is not the experience. The experience is spatial, temporal, and bodily.

Audience members (approximately 400 per performance, against roughly 25 performers) wear identical white masks upon entry. They are separated from companions. They are told: "Fortune favors the bold." They are released into the building and left to navigate it alone. There is no guide, no program, no seat. You walk. You open doors. You enter rooms. You follow performers or abandon them. You discover spaces or miss them entirely. No two audience members have the same experience, because no two audience members traverse the same path through the building.

The horror mechanisms are precise and physical.

*Voyeurism*: The mask transforms the audience into anonymous observers. You watch performers execute intimate, violent, and erotic choreography from a distance of inches. You witness a murder and cannot intervene. You watch a character undress and feel the shame of watching. The mask provides anonymity but not innocence — you chose to follow, chose to enter this room, chose to watch. The horror is not what you see but what your watching reveals about you.

*Isolation*: You are alone among masked strangers. The friend you entered with has vanished into a different floor. Every decision — which corridor to take, which performer to follow, which door to open — is yours alone. There is no collective experience to process afterward, because no one else saw what you saw. The isolation produces a dream-like solipsism: the experience feels private, subjective, unreliable, as if it might not have happened.

*Silence*: The audience cannot speak. This is a rule enforced by the masks (which symbolically seal the mouth) and by social pressure (the silence of hundreds of masked figures creates an oppressive hush). The inability to speak — to ask questions, to express fear, to communicate with fellow audience members — produces a specific vulnerability: you cannot recruit others into your experience, cannot confirm that what you are seeing is real, cannot break the fiction by naming it as fiction.

*Physical proximity*: Performers can touch you. A hand on your shoulder. A breath near your ear. A performer who pulls you into a room, closes the door, and performs a scene for you alone — the "one-on-one" encounter, the most prized experience in Sleep No More's economy of participation. In these encounters, the performer addresses you directly: you are not an observer but a character, a confessor, a co-conspirator. Your body is in the fiction. The fiction is on your skin.

*Non-linear narrative*: The show runs on a three-hour loop. Performers execute the same choreographic sequences three times. You encounter fragments — a dance, a chase, a murder, a kiss — in whatever order your wandering produces. The narrative is not told to you; you assemble it from the fragments you happened to witness, and the gaps in your account (the scenes you missed, the rooms you never found) are irreducible. The experience is structurally incomplete, and the incompleteness is the design.

For PHANTASMATA, Sleep No More's principles translate from physical to digital space with surprising directness. *Voyeurism*: the audience encountering a PHANTASMATA video-log is watching footage not intended for them. *Isolation*: encounters happen alone, on one's own screen, with no communal context. *Non-linear assembly*: no audience member encounters all artifacts in the same order, or encounters all artifacts at all. The gaps are irreducible. The incompleteness is the design.

#### Then She Fell and the Intimacy Limit

Third Rail Projects' *Then She Fell* (2012-2023) pushed the immersive form toward its intimacy extreme. Performed in a former hospital in Brooklyn, the show admitted only 15 audience members per performance — a ratio of roughly 1:1 with performers. The source material is Alice in Wonderland and the life of Lewis Carroll, and the production moves the audience through a sequence of rooms in which they drink real tea, take real pills (candy), read real letters, and engage in sustained one-on-one encounters with performers who maintain eye contact, whisper secrets, and sometimes lead them by the hand into spaces no other audience member will enter.

The horror of *Then She Fell* — and it is a horror, despite its whimsical source material — is the horror of attention. In Sleep No More, the mask provides anonymity; in Then She Fell, there is no mask. The performer sees you. The performer adjusts their performance to you. You are not watching a show; you are in a relationship, however brief, with a person who is simultaneously a character and a human being whose gaze you cannot escape. The intimacy is the uncanny: this person is performing for you alone, and the performance is calibrated to your reactions, and the calibration is itself a performance, and the recursion of "is this person responding to me or performing a response to me?" is the epistemological vertigo that immersive theater shares with PHANTASMATA's fundamental design question.

For PHANTASMATA, Then She Fell demonstrates the principle of *scale as intensity*. The smaller the audience, the more intense the participation. A mock-post that appears to be addressed to a specific person (even if the specificity is illusory) is more disturbing than a mock-post addressed to everyone. A video-log in which the subject appears to notice the camera — appears to be aware that *you* are watching — is more disturbing than a video-log of an oblivious subject. The fiction that seems to see you produces a fundamentally different dread from the fiction that does not know you exist.

#### Punchdrunk's Subsequent Works

*The Drowned Man* (2013-2014, London) represented a 1960s Hollywood studio where characters are actors and directors — the audience witnesses both "real" events and "filmed" scenes being shot on sets within the set. This doubled frame — watching a performance of people performing — maps directly onto the $KON_SPIRAL dial's "performance haunt" parameter. *The Burnt City* (2022-2024, London) scaled the form to its largest iteration: two adjacent warehouses representing Troy and the Greek camp. It demonstrated that immersive mechanisms function at city scale but also revealed a limitation: at very large scale, encounter density decreases and the experience drifts toward architectural tourism. The lesson: intimacy and scale are inversely correlated in participatory horror.

### B4. Horror Attractions and Experience Design

#### Extreme Haunts: The Consent Boundary

The extreme haunt — a participatory horror experience that subjects the audience to physical contact, confinement, sensory deprivation, and psychological pressure — represents the participatory form's most contested territory. These experiences are not theater in any conventional sense; they are endurance trials designed to produce genuine fear, discomfort, and (in the most extreme cases) panic.

*McKamey Manor* (San Diego, later Summertown, Tennessee) is the most notorious extreme haunt. Participants sign a 40-page waiver. Experiences last up to 10 hours. Participants are physically restrained, submerged in water, placed in confined spaces, exposed to simulated violence, and subjected to sustained psychological pressure. The experience has no jump scares, no monsters, no narrative — only the sustained application of stress to a consenting participant's body and mind. No one has ever completed the full experience. McKamey Manor has been the subject of legal challenges and journalistic investigations, and it represents the participatory form's outer boundary: the point at which "horror experience" becomes indistinguishable from "ordeal."

*Blackout* (New York, Los Angeles) operates in a more formally controlled space. Participants enter alone. They navigate dark rooms. Performers touch them, speak to them, manipulate them. A safe word is provided: "SAFETY" ends the experience immediately. The safe word is the critical formal innovation — it is the explicit marker of the consent boundary, the mechanism by which the participant retains agency within an experience designed to strip agency away. The safe word transforms the experience from ordeal to contract: both parties agree to the terms, and either party can terminate. This contractual structure is the ethical architecture that separates legitimate extreme haunts from abuse.

*Delusion* (Los Angeles, 2011-present), created by Jon Braver, operates as interactive horror theater: participants move through elaborate sets (haunted houses, derelict hospitals, magical realms) and interact with performers who respond to their actions. Delusion includes puzzles, physical challenges, and narrative choices that affect the experience's trajectory. It occupies a middle ground between the passive voyeurism of Sleep No More and the physical extremity of Blackout — the audience acts, but within designed parameters.

For PHANTASMATA, extreme haunts illuminate the ethical boundary by showing what lies on the other side of it. McKamey Manor demonstrates that participatory horror without ethical architecture produces exploitation. Blackout demonstrates that the safe word — the explicit opt-out mechanism — is the minimum viable ethical structure. PHANTASMATA's digital outputs do not require safe words (the audience can close a browser tab), but they do require an equivalent: the eventual availability of the frame that identifies the fiction as fiction. The audience's initial uncertainty ("is this real?") must have a resolution pathway. If the uncertainty is permanent and irresolvable, the experience is not participatory horror but deception.

#### Escape Rooms and Commercial Haunts: The Scare as Engineered System

The escape room industry — originating in Japan circa 2007, reaching global saturation by the early 2020s — literalized the locked-room mystery. Horror-themed escape rooms created a hybrid form where cognitive challenge and affective dread operate simultaneously. Their formal innovation is *time pressure as horror*: a visible countdown converts intellectual engagement into bodily stress response, mapping onto PHANTASMATA's temporal strategies (upload schedules that create urgency, timestamps that suggest approaching deadlines).

Commercial haunted attractions — Halloween Horror Nights (since 1991), Knott's Scary Farm (since 1973), Eastern State Penitentiary, and hundreds of regional counterparts — constitute a $300-million annual industry that has refined scare engineering into systematic practice. Their vocabulary — the *startle scare* (sudden stimulus triggering involuntary reflex), the *corridor of anticipation* (audience knows a scare is coming but not when), the *scare actor reveal* (performer disguised as environment), the *compression point* (narrowing passage producing claustrophobia), the *false exit* (apparent escape leading deeper in) — is crude compared to Sleep No More's choreography but *engineered* through decades of iterative testing. The contribution to PHANTASMATA is structural: horror can be designed as a system of calibrated stimuli with partially predictable audience responses.

Walt Disney Imagineering's concept of *environmental storytelling* — designed space communicating narrative through details without exposition — is directly relevant. The Haunted Mansion tells its story through wallpaper patterns, furniture arrangements, and environmental decay. This is precisely the principle behind a PHANTASMATA screen-capture: desktop wallpaper, folder names, notification badges, browser tabs — all environmental storytelling elements communicating narrative through screen-spatial evidence.

### B5. Digital Participatory Horror

#### Collective Spectatorship and Interactive Narrative

*Twitch Plays Pokemon* (2014) — tens of thousands of viewers simultaneously controlling a single game — is not horror but establishes the infrastructure for digital participatory horror: collective, real-time, chaotic decision-making through a chat interface. Horror game streaming has produced *parasocial fear*: the audience experiences fear twice — from the game content and from the streamer's reaction. The streamer's body, visible in the webcam corner (flinching, covering eyes), amplifies and authenticates the horror. If the streamer is afraid, the thing must be frightening. For PHANTASMATA, this suggests content *designed to be reacted to* — artifacts so ambiguously real that the reactor's uncertainty ("wait, is this real?") becomes a secondary distribution channel.

*Bandersnatch* (Netflix, 2018) deployed interactivity as a *horror mechanism*: the protagonist becomes aware that someone is controlling his choices, producing existential dread. The audience's choosing is not navigation — it is the horror's cause. Supermassive Games' *Until Dawn* (2015) and *The Dark Pictures Anthology* (2019-present) use multiplayer decision-making where bad choices produce permanent character deaths. These works demonstrate *agency as horror vector*: responsibility under uncertainty produces dread. A PHANTASMATA artifact that includes a call to action — a URL, a comment prompt — transforms the audience from observer to participant, producing the sensation of having entered the fiction through one's own agency.

#### Social Media Horror Events and Their Consequences

The participatory horror form's most dangerous manifestation is the *social media challenge*: viral instruction sets that produce real-world action in audiences who may not recognize fiction as fiction.

The *Momo Challenge* (2018-2019) was a hoax — no coordinated targeting of children existed — but the moral panic was real. The *Slender Man stabbing* (Waukesha, Wisconsin, 2014) is the most consequential instance: two twelve-year-old girls stabbed a classmate nineteen times to appease the fictional Slender Man. The victim survived; the assailants were committed to mental health institutions. The case is not an indictment of participatory horror as a form — millions of fans never committed violence — but it is an inescapable datum: the boundary between fiction and reality, when deliberately made porous, can be crossed in directions the fiction's creators did not intend and cannot control.

For PHANTASMATA, these cases establish the ethical floor: artifacts must not contain content interpretable as genuine instructions for harmful action. The distinction between "this creates uncertainty about what is real" and "this instructs dangerous action" must be architecturally enforced through the artifacts' formal properties.

### B6. PHANTASMATA as Participatory Experience

PHANTASMATA's output formats are not merely *informed by* participatory horror — they *are* participatory horror, operating in the ambient-encounter mode rather than the active-engagement mode. The distinction is crucial. An ARG like Marble Hornets asks the audience to actively investigate: watch entries, decode totheark, cross-reference timestamps, construct theories. An immersive theater piece like Sleep No More asks the audience to actively navigate: walk, choose, follow, open doors. PHANTASMATA asks the audience to do something simpler and, in some ways, more disturbing: *encounter*.

A mock-post that appears in a real feed is a participatory artifact — the audience stumbles upon it while scrolling, participating in the horror through habitual behavior. A video-log uploaded without context is discovered through search or recommendation; the audience watches, rewatches, checks other uploads, reads comments, searches for information — each act deepening the relationship to the artifact. A screen-capture circulating as a decontextualized screenshot is narrative-assembled-by-the-audience: they construct meaning from interface elements, timestamps, notifications. The audience is the author of their own dread.

PHANTASMATA does not build a game or a theater. It builds *rabbit holes* — artifacts whose formal properties invite investigation, whose ontological status is ambiguous, whose incompleteness demands completion by the audience's imagination. Participation is structured not by rules or mechanics but by the artifact's formal qualities: ambiguity, detail, platform fidelity, refusal to declare itself as fiction.

## C) Techniques Inventory

**1. The TINAG Principle (This Is Not A Game)**
The fiction never acknowledges that it is fiction. No credits, no disclaimers, no behind-the-scenes content, no winking references to the fictional frame. The artifact presents itself as what it appears to be — a personal video, a social media post, a recovered document — and maintains this presentation unconditionally. The horror function is epistemic: the audience's uncertainty about the artifact's ontological status is sustained by the absence of any authorial signal that would resolve it. *The Beast*, *Marble Hornets*, *The Sun Vanished*. Affinity: all five output formats — the TINAG principle is PHANTASMATA's default mode of address.

**2. The Rabbit Hole**
A single, apparently innocuous artifact — a strange video, an unexplained image, a cryptic post — that serves as the entry point to a larger, hidden body of content. The rabbit hole is designed to be encountered casually and to provoke investigation: "what is this? where did it come from? is there more?" Its formal properties balance intrigue (enough strangeness to provoke curiosity) with plausibility (enough normalcy to avoid being dismissed as obvious fiction). *I Love Bees* (website glitch), *Marble Hornets* (Entry 1), *Year Zero* (USB drive). Affinity: video-log (a single disturbing clip), mock-post (a single anomalous post), screen-capture (a single unsettling screenshot).

**3. The Trail of Breadcrumbs**
A sequence of artifacts, each containing a detail — a URL, a name, a coordinate, a timestamp — that leads to the next artifact. The trail is not explicit (no "click here for the next clue"); the connecting details are embedded within the artifacts' content and must be discovered through attention and investigation. The horror function is gradual immersion: each step along the trail draws the audience deeper into the fiction, and each step is a volitional act that increases the audience's investment. *The Beast* (linked websites), *Ben Drowned* (coded forum posts leading to YouTube videos), *Petscop* (in-game text referencing real events). Affinity: text-fragment (embedded references to other artifacts), video-log (background details visible on investigation), screen-capture (URLs, filenames, and metadata visible in the interface).

**4. The Dead Drop**
A physical or digital object placed in a real-world or real-platform location for the audience to discover. Physical dead drops: USB drives (Year Zero), packages (EverymanHYBRID), printed materials at specific GPS coordinates (TribeTwelve). Digital dead drops: unlisted YouTube videos discoverable only through URL, password-protected files whose passwords are embedded in other artifacts, hidden directories on websites. The horror function is materialization — the fiction becomes a physical or discoverable-digital object that the audience possesses, collapsing the distance between the fiction's world and the audience's world. *Year Zero* (USB drives at concerts), *EverymanHYBRID* (mailed packages), *TribeTwelve* (geocached objects). Affinity: all five formats when embedded in discoverable rather than promoted locations.

**5. The Puppet Master**
The hidden author or authorial team who designs and orchestrates the participatory experience without revealing their presence. The puppet master creates artifacts, responds to audience actions, adjusts the narrative in real time, and maintains the TINAG principle from behind the curtain. The horror function is the uncanny authorship: the audience senses that someone is orchestrating the experience but cannot identify who, producing the paranoid suspicion that the world is being manipulated by an invisible intelligence. *The Beast* (Microsoft's design team), *Marble Hornets* (Troy Wagner and Joseph DeLage), *Sleep No More* (Punchdrunk's creative team and stage managers). Affinity: the puppet master is PHANTASMATA's authorial position — the creator who designs artifacts that appear undesigned, who structures experiences that appear unstructured.

**6. The Comment Section Detective**
The audience's collective analytical activity — cross-referencing, frame-by-frame analysis, theory construction — conducted in comment sections, forums, and wikis. This detective work is constitutive of the experience, not supplementary. The horror function is collective paranoia: investigative intensity mirrors the narrative's paranoid logic, and looking closer deepens investment and dread. *Marble Hornets* (Unfiction forums), *Petscop* (r/Petscop), *This House Has People In It* (abfortiori.com). Affinity: mock-post (provoking analytical discussion), video-log (discoverable background detail), text-fragment (references rewarding cross-referencing).

**7. The One-on-One Encounter**
The participatory experience addresses a single audience member directly, isolating them for intimate interaction. Physical: a performer pulls you into a room and speaks to you alone. Digital: a character's account sends a direct message, or an artifact includes a detail that seems to address your individual experience. The horror function is the dissolution of anonymity — the fiction *knows you*. *Sleep No More* (one-on-one encounters), *Then She Fell* (intimate interactions), *EverymanHYBRID* (personalized messages). Affinity: mock-post (apparently addressing specific individuals), text-fragment (second-person address that feels personal).

**8. The Masked Audience**
Anonymity imposed on the audience, transforming spectators into an undifferentiated mass. In digital horror, anonymity is the platform's native condition — usernames and absent faces produce depersonalization. The horror function is dual: the masked audience is both protected (anonymous, free to observe) and vulnerable (isolated, unable to recruit reality-anchors). *Sleep No More* (white masks), *4chan* (enforced anonymity), *Twitch chat* (mass anonymous viewing). Affinity: screen-capture (the screen as mask — observing through it, protected by it, isolated within it).

**9. The Safe Word Boundary**
An explicit opt-out mechanism that establishes the consent boundary within a participatory horror experience. The safe word (Blackout's "SAFETY," escape rooms' panic buttons, immersive theater's staff-in-black who escort distressed audience members to exits) is the formal marker that distinguishes participatory horror from coercion. Its presence acknowledges that the experience is designed and that the participant retains ultimate agency. The horror function is paradoxical: the safe word *increases* horror by establishing that the experience is intense enough to require one, while simultaneously *containing* horror by guaranteeing escape. *Blackout* (the word "SAFETY"), *Delusion* (staff intervention protocols), *McKamey Manor* (contested — the 40-page waiver complicates the opt-out). Affinity: in PHANTASMATA's digital context, the safe word equivalent is the *frame reveal* — the eventual availability of information that identifies the artifact as fiction.

**10. The Platform-Native Artifact**
A horror artifact created in the native format of its host platform, exploiting the platform's conventions, affordances, and credibility to sustain the fiction. A YouTube video that looks like a genuine amateur upload. A tweet that looks like a genuine crisis post. A Reddit post that adheres to a subreddit's formatting rules. The platform-native artifact's horror function is *infrastructural camouflage*: it is indistinguishable from the platform's genuine content, and the audience's inability to distinguish it from reality is produced not by the artifact's sophistication but by its fidelity to the platform's norms. *Marble Hornets* (YouTube native), *The Sun Vanished* (Twitter native), *NoSleep stories* (Reddit native), *Daisy Brown* (YouTube vlog native). Affinity: this technique IS PHANTASMATA's production method — every output format is designed as a platform-native artifact.

**11. The Upload-Date Narrative**
The use of an artifact's real-world publication date as a narrative element. The gap between uploads implies elapsed time, off-screen events, periods of absence or silence. A long gap between uploads produces anxiety: what happened to the creator? A burst of rapid uploads produces urgency: something is escalating. The upload schedule is not a distribution strategy but a temporal narrative layer experienced by the audience in real time. *Marble Hornets* (irregular upload schedule creating real-time tension), *Daisy Brown* (gaps implying off-camera crises), *Petscop* (long hiatuses followed by information-dense uploads). Affinity: video-log (upload schedule as temporal narrative), mock-post (posting frequency as behavioral indicator), text-fragment (document dates as chronological evidence).

**12. The Real-World Bleed**
The extension of fiction into the audience's physical or digital reality: packages mailed to home addresses, phone calls received on personal phones, artifacts appearing in physical locations, in-fiction accounts interacting with the audience's real social media profiles. The horror function is *ontological contamination* — the fiction crosses the boundary between its medium and the audience's lived environment, producing the sensation that the fiction is *in the world* rather than contained within a screen or a theater. *EverymanHYBRID* (mailed packages), *I Love Bees* (payphone calls), *Year Zero* (USB drives at concerts), *TribeTwelve* (geocached dead drops). Affinity: mock-post (fiction appearing in real feeds among real content), audio-log (audio files that could be received as voicemails or voice messages).

**13. The Consent Negotiation**
The process by which the audience agrees to enter and the terms under which they may exit. Physical: wristbands, waivers, orientation. ARGs: the rabbit hole (voluntary entry), community understanding. Digital: follow/subscribe, platform controls (unfollow, block, close tab). The horror function is *complicity*: the audience chose to enter, chose to continue, chose not to leave. Fear is partly self-inflicted, and knowing this does not diminish it. *Sleep No More* (mask ritual), *Blackout* (waiver and safe word), *Marble Hornets* (subscription as consent). Affinity: all formats — engagement is always a consent act.

**14. The Fragment as Invitation**
An artifact that is deliberately incomplete — a video that ends mid-sentence, a screenshot that crops critical information, a text that references events not documented anywhere — serving as an invitation for the audience to construct the missing content through imagination or investigation. The incompleteness is not a failure of the artifact but its primary design feature: the gap is where the audience enters, and the audience's imagination fills the gap with content more disturbing than anything the creator could provide. *Marble Hornets* (numbered entries with gaps implying missing footage), *Petscop* (game content that implies a larger, undocumented reality), *Sleep No More* (the rooms you never entered, the scenes you never witnessed). Affinity: all five formats — every PHANTASMATA artifact should be a fragment, never a complete account.

**15. The Collective Investigation**
The audience's self-organized effort to solve, decode, or map the narrative — conducted through forums, subreddits, Discord servers, wikis. Transforms passive consumption into active collaboration. The horror function is *the conspiracy board*: the audience's analytical infrastructure mirrors the narrative's paranoid architecture. To investigate is to become paranoid. *Marble Hornets* (Unfiction forums), *Cicada 3301*, *Petscop* (r/Petscop), *This House Has People In It* (abfortiori.com). Affinity: mock-post (provoking investigation), video-log (discoverable detail), text-fragment (puzzles or encoded references).

**16. The Voyeur Position**
The audience observes events they cannot influence — watching through a camera not theirs, reading a document not addressed to them. Horror through moral implication: why are you watching this? What does your watching say about you? *Sleep No More* (masked observation of violence), *Paranormal Activity* (surveillance footage watched post-mortem), *Marble Hornets* (the audience watching Jay's recovered entries). Affinity: video-log (unauthorized viewer), screen-capture (viewing a private screen), audio-log (listening to a private recording).

**17. The Architectural Narrative**
The space — physical or digital — tells a story through design, objects, wear patterns, anomalies. The audience assembles narrative from environmental evidence without exposition. The horror function is *archaeological dread*: reconstruction from traces is always incomplete and potentially misleading. *Sleep No More* (100 detailed rooms), *Escape rooms* (environmental puzzles), *This House Has People In It*, *Disney Haunted Mansion*. Affinity: screen-capture (desktop as architectural space — wallpaper, folders, notifications as storytelling), video-log (filmed space details as evidence).

**18. The Temporal Loop**
The experience repeats with variations that accumulate meaning through repetition. The horror function is *inescapability*: the loop denies resolution and the possibility that horror will end. *Sleep No More* (three-loop structure), *Bandersnatch* (branches looping to same events), *Petscop* (game mechanics repeating with variations). Affinity: video-log (a video that loops, or uploads repeating events with variations), text-fragment (a document circling back to its opening).

**19. The Infrastructural Parasite**
Fiction that attaches to real-world infrastructure — real websites, phone networks, social platforms — using that infrastructure's credibility as its own. The horror function is *ubiquity*: fiction distributed through daily-life infrastructure, not confined to marked spaces. *The Beast* (real websites), *I Love Bees* (real payphones), *Year Zero* (real USB drives), *The Sun Vanished* (real Twitter). Affinity: this IS PHANTASMATA's fundamental strategy — every output inhabits real platforms.

**20. The Agency Trap**
The audience is given a choice — genuine or illusory — and the act of choosing implicates them in the horror's outcome. Choosing transforms the audience from observer to agent. The horror function is *responsibility*: you chose this, you clicked that link, what happened is partly your fault. *Bandersnatch* (narrative choices), *The Dark Pictures Anthology* (multiplayer decisions), *Sleep No More* (following a performer into darkness), *Blackout* (continuing rather than saying "SAFETY"). Affinity: mock-post (asking for audience response), video-log (ending with a question), text-fragment (providing a URL or coordinate inviting the next step).

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### Director Dial Mappings

Participatory horror maps to PHANTASMATA's three director dials with a distinctive configuration: $KON_SPIRAL dominates, $LYNCH_DRIFT provides the experiential texture, and $ARGENTO_GEL operates at low settings with selective spikes.

#### $KON_SPIRAL: Primary Dial (Native Range: 70-95)

Participatory horror is the $KON_SPIRAL dial's natural habitat, and this domain operates at the dial's highest native range across all ten world research topics. Every parameter of the $KON_SPIRAL dial — mediation collapse, performance haunt, obsession recursion, memory unreliability — maps directly onto a core mechanism of participatory horror.

**Mediation collapse** is participatory horror's defining achievement. The entire domain exists to eliminate the frame that signals "this is fiction." PHANTASMATA's output formats — artifacts designed to occupy real platforms without fictional framing — are mediation collapse by design.

**Performance haunt** manifests as the *artifact that outlives the experience*. Marble Hornets entries remain on YouTube after the series ends. Year Zero USB drives sit in drawers years after the campaign. PHANTASMATA's artifacts are designed as such deposits — objects left in the digital world that persist, discoverable years after creation.

**Obsession recursion** transforms casual encounter into deep engagement — the compulsion to go deeper, to investigate more thoroughly, to achieve comprehensive understanding of a system designed to resist it. This is the participation engine: the Marble Hornets viewer who watches all 87 entries, the Petscop analyst who rewatches a dozen times for hidden detail.

**Memory unreliability** manifests as the participant's own experience becoming unreliable. The Sleep No More attendee cannot be sure what they saw. The Marble Hornets viewer cannot separate theories from text. Participation produces memory, and the memory is as unreliable as the participation was disorienting.

$KON_SPIRAL at 70-80 produces artifacts creating productive uncertainty. At 80-90, mediation collapse intensifies: artifacts that interact with the audience's reality and appear in unexpected contexts. At 90-95, collapse is near-total: artifacts genuinely indistinguishable from nonfiction, whose fictional status requires sustained investigation to determine.

#### $LYNCH_DRIFT: Secondary Dial (Native Range: 15-60)

Participatory horror engages $LYNCH_DRIFT primarily through two parameters: *dream intrusion* and *mundane anchor dissolution*.

**Dream intrusion** at low settings (15-30) produces ambient uncanny — the sensation that something is "off" without identifiable cause. At higher settings (40-60), the experience's logic begins to resemble dream logic: spaces that do not connect rationally, timelines that do not cohere, identities that blur between performer and character.

**Mundane anchor dissolution** is the process by which the familiar becomes strange — the YouTube interface becoming the frame for unexplained horror, the Twitter timeline becoming the medium for apocalypse. Participatory horror's power is proportional to the mundanity of the anchor it dissolves.

Above 60, $LYNCH_DRIFT undermines participatory horror's requirements. If the experience becomes too obviously dreamlike, the audience recategorizes it as "art" and the participatory contract breaks. PHANTASMATA's artifacts must feel real enough to sustain uncertainty.

#### $ARGENTO_GEL: Tertiary Dial (Native Range: 0-20)

Participatory horror operates at the lowest $ARGENTO_GEL settings of any domain in the PHANTASMATA system. The domain's aesthetic is defined by the mundane — the platform interface, the amateur video quality, the everyday space — and chromatic extravagance, operatic staging, and ritualistic violence all signal the presence of an author, which the TINAG principle forbids.

However, selective $ARGENTO_GEL intrusions can function as anomaly markers. A video-log that suddenly floods with saturated color for three seconds — rationalizable as a neon sign or screen reflection — disrupts the platform-native aesthetic without breaking the documentary contract.

At 0-5, the artifact is chromatically indistinguishable from genuine content. At 10-15, subtle color anomalies mark narrative significance. At 15-20, color becomes a recurring motif recognizable to investigating audiences. Above 20, artifacts look produced and the participatory contract weakens.

### Recommended Dial Recipes for Participatory PHANTASMATA Outputs

**Recipe 1: "The Rabbit Hole" (initial-encounter mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 5 (chromatically indistinguishable from genuine content)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 20 (one detail that is "off" — subtle ambient uncanny)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 75 (TINAG active, platform-native, uncertainty sustained)
- Primary techniques: T01 (TINAG), T02 (Rabbit Hole), T10 (Platform-Native Artifact), T14 (Fragment as Invitation)
- Primary output formats: mock-post, video-log, screen-capture
- Notes: The initial-encounter artifact must be indistinguishable from genuine content at casual inspection. Only sustained attention reveals the anomaly. This is PHANTASMATA's primary production mode.

**Recipe 2: "The Deep Archive" (investigation-reward mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 10 (subtle color anomalies in specific artifacts)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 40 (spatial and temporal coherence weakening on investigation)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 85 (dense with discoverable detail, recursive references, implied completeness)
- Primary techniques: T03 (Trail of Breadcrumbs), T06 (Comment Section Detective), T15 (Collective Investigation), T17 (Architectural Narrative)
- Primary output formats: text-fragment, screen-capture, video-log
- Notes: Artifacts designed for the audience that has passed through the rabbit hole and is actively investigating. Denser, more detailed, more formally complex. Rewards close reading and cross-referencing.

**Recipe 3: "The Bleeding Edge" (reality-contamination mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 15 (color as recurring anomaly — a specific hue that appears across multiple artifacts)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 55 (dream intrusion active — the mundane world is destabilizing)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 90 (mediation collapse near-total, fiction indistinguishable from platform reality)
- Primary techniques: T12 (Real-World Bleed), T07 (One-on-One Encounter), T19 (Infrastructural Parasite), T20 (Agency Trap)
- Primary output formats: mock-post, audio-log, video-log
- Notes: Maximum-intensity participatory horror. Use sparingly. Requires ethical framework compliance (see below). Artifacts in this mode approach the consent boundary and must include frame-reveal pathways.

**Recipe 4: "The Voyeur's Gallery" (immersive-observation mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 0 (zero chromatic intervention — pure platform aesthetic)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 30 (ambient uncanny — the space/screen is slightly wrong)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 70 (voyeuristic position established, audience complicity engaged)
- Primary techniques: T16 (Voyeur Position), T08 (Masked Audience), T11 (Upload-Date Narrative), T14 (Fragment as Invitation)
- Primary output formats: video-log, screen-capture
- Notes: The audience watches content not intended for them. The moral dimension of watching is part of the horror. No interactivity required — the audience's passivity is the participation.

### The Ethical Framework: Uncertainty vs. Deception

PHANTASMATA's creative mandate — "audience uncertainty is the design intent" — requires an ethical framework that distinguishes productive uncertainty from destructive deception. This framework is not optional. It is a production constraint as binding as the aesthetic axes, the director dials, and the output format specifications. Participatory horror without ethical architecture is not art; it is manipulation.

The framework operates on three principles.

**Principle 1: Uncertainty, Not Assertion.** PHANTASMATA artifacts create the *question* "is this real?" They never create the *assertion* "this IS real." The distinction is formal: an assertion requires the creator to actively defend the fiction's reality when challenged (denying authorship, fabricating evidence of authenticity, attacking skeptics). A question requires only that the creator decline to resolve the ambiguity preemptively. PHANTASMATA artifacts do not claim to be real. They simply do not claim to be fictional. The audience's uncertainty is produced by the absence of the fiction-marking frame, not by the presence of reality-asserting claims.

**Principle 2: The Frame Reveal.** Every PHANTASMATA artifact must have a discoverable frame-reveal pathway — a mechanism by which an investigating audience member can determine that the artifact is fiction. This pathway need not be obvious (it should not be obvious — that would preempt the uncertainty that is the design intent). But it must exist. Examples: the creator's identity is discoverable through account investigation. The artifact contains details that are verifiably fictional (a street address that does not exist, a date that does not correspond to reality, a reference to an event that can be confirmed as non-historical). The artifact is linked, through the trail of breadcrumbs, to other artifacts whose cumulative pattern is recognizable as authored. The frame reveal is the digital equivalent of the safe word: it guarantees that the audience's participation is ultimately voluntary, that they can exit the uncertainty when they choose to investigate deeply enough.

**Principle 3: No Harmful Instructions.** PHANTASMATA artifacts never contain instructions that could produce real-world harm if followed by an audience member who believes the fiction is real. No phone numbers of real uninvolved people. No addresses of real uninvolved locations. No instructions to perform dangerous actions. No content that could be interpreted as a genuine call for help from a real person in danger (which could trigger emergency services responses). The Momo/Slender Man failure mode is architecturally prevented by refusing to produce artifacts whose misinterpretation as real could produce harmful action.

These three principles — uncertainty not assertion, the frame reveal, no harmful instructions — constitute PHANTASMATA's ethical architecture for participatory horror. They permit the project to create artifacts of genuine epistemic power — artifacts that make audiences pause, investigate, doubt, wonder — while preventing the artifacts from crossing the line between participatory art and manipulative deception.

### Operational Synthesis: PHANTASMATA as Ambient Participatory Horror

This brief reveals a spectrum from high-engagement participation (the audience must actively do things) to low-engagement participation (the audience must merely encounter things). PHANTASMATA operates at the low-engagement end, and this positioning is strategic.

High-engagement participatory horror (ARGs, immersive theater, escape rooms) requires investment and self-selection. Only people who choose to play have the experience. This self-selection weakens the TINAG proposition — a community of ARG players knows they are playing a game.

Low-engagement participatory horror — *ambient participatory horror* — requires only encounter. The experience finds the audience, embedded in the platforms they already inhabit. The encounter is involuntary, and involuntary encounter is more disturbing than voluntary participation: the audience has not had time to construct a frame. They have not entered a game. They have simply scrolled, and something wrong has appeared.

This is PHANTASMATA's operational model: artifacts that exist as ambient disturbances — unframed, unmarked, producing epistemological vertigo in the audience that encounters them. The question is not "is this a good horror story?" but "is this real?" The answer — unavailable at the moment of encounter, discoverable upon investigation — is the experience. The interval between the question and the answer is where PHANTASMATA lives. That interval — uncertain, productive, temporary, and ethically bounded — is the participatory horror that this project exists to create.
