## A) Topic Definition and Scope

This brief investigates the cinematic rendering of dream states — the formal vocabularies, structural logics, and material techniques by which filmmakers have translated the experience of dreaming into audiovisual form across nearly a century of practice. The scope consolidates two research paths that share a common object (the oneiric) but approach it from distinct formal traditions: *surrealist cinema* (Buñuel, Cocteau, Deren, Švankmajer, Brothers Quay, Jodorowsky, Guy Maddin) and *oneiric narrative* (Tarkovsky, Resnais, Marker, Kubrick, Gondry, Kaufman, Carax, Weerasethakul). The first tradition renders dream through shock, juxtaposition, and the violation of rational expectation. The second renders dream through duration, texture, and the dissolution of boundaries between memory, perception, and imagination. Both traditions produce cinema in which the operating logic is not causal but associative — not "this happens, therefore that happens" but "this image, therefore that feeling, therefore this other image." PHANTASMATA requires both.

The project's name — CHTHON-ONEIROS — literally means "underworld-dream." The container's designation as Field II: Present Dreaming positions the entire creative enterprise within the oneiric register. The project's reference artist is Andrei Tarkovsky, whose cinema demonstrates that dream can be rendered through patience, composition, and the material behavior of water, fire, and wind rather than through surrealist shock or digital spectacle. This domain is therefore not one research topic among ten — it is the ancestral lineage. Dream cinema is PHANTASMATA's formal genealogy, the tradition from which its creative outputs descend and against which they must be measured.

The consolidation of surrealist cinema and oneiric narrative into a single brief is motivated by a specific analytical claim: that these two traditions represent not two genres but two solutions to a single formal problem — the problem of rendering, in a medium that records the visible, an experience (dreaming) that is visible only to the dreamer. Every filmmaker in this brief has confronted the same impossibility: film is a photographic medium, indexically bound to the real world that passes before the lens, and dream is an experience that has no external existence, no photographable surface, no objective manifestation. The history of dream cinema is the history of strategies for resolving this impossibility — for making the camera show what only the sleeping mind can see.

The surrealist solution is substitution: replace the logic of the waking world with the logic of dream, and film the result. If dream operates by free association, film dream by cutting between images according to associative rather than narrative logic. If dream violates physical law, film objects that move impossibly, spaces that defy geometry, bodies that transform without explanation. The surrealists made dream visible by staging it — by constructing, in front of the camera, a world that behaves the way dreams behave.

The oneiric solution is modulation: do not replace the waking world with dream but gradually dissolve the boundary between them, so that the viewer cannot identify the moment at which waking ends and dream begins. If dream is characterized by the absence of clear transitions, render transitions ambiguous. If dream is characterized by temporal distortion, manipulate cinematic duration. If dream is characterized by heightened significance — the sense that every object is meaningful, that the world is charged with obscure purpose — achieve this through composition, lighting, and the sustained contemplation of ordinary objects until they become luminous and strange.

For PHANTASMATA, the distinction between these two solutions maps onto a specific production challenge: how to render dream in found-digital formats (video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post) that are inherently documentary, inherently "waking," inherently committed to the indexical real. The surrealist solution — staging impossible events in front of the camera — is largely unavailable to PHANTASMATA, whose creative mandate specifies that outputs must feel found, not produced. The oneiric solution — modulating the boundary between waking and dream within apparently documentary material — is the native strategy. But the surrealist tradition's inventory of dream-rendering techniques (the associative cut, the spatial impossibility, the object that transforms) can be translated into found-digital vocabulary if the techniques are understood at the level of formal principle rather than at the level of material execution. A video-log in which the camera's timestamp jumps forward without visible edit is a found-digital translation of the surrealist temporal discontinuity. A screen-capture in which the same notification appears three times with minor variations is a found-digital translation of the dream's repetition-with-difference. Understanding the formal principles — extracting them from their original cinematic contexts — is what makes them portable.

The time window extends from Un Chien Andalou (1929) to Memoria (2021) and beyond, covering nearly a century of formal innovation. The geographical scope is genuinely global: France (Buñuel's adopted home, Cocteau, Resnais, Marker, Carax), Spain (Buñuel's origin), the United States (Deren, Kubrick, Gondry, Kaufman), Russia/Soviet Union (Tarkovsky), the Czech Republic (Švankmajer), the United Kingdom (Brothers Quay), Canada (Maddin), Chile/Mexico/France (Jodorowsky), Japan (Kurosawa, Oshii, Obayashi, Kon), and Thailand (Weerasethakul). Dream cinema is not a Western tradition with non-Western additions; it is a genuinely polycentric tradition in which formal innovations emerge from multiple cultural contexts simultaneously, often without direct influence.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What are the distinct formal vocabularies by which cinema has rendered dream states, and how do these vocabularies differ in their epistemological implications — that is, what does each vocabulary assume about the relationship between dream and waking, between the visible and the invisible, between the filmable and the unfilmable?
2. How does the surrealist tradition's commitment to automatism (the suppression of rational control in favor of unconscious association) manifest in specific cinematic techniques, and what is the relationship between surrealist automatism and dream logic as a structural principle?
3. What is Tarkovsky's specific contribution to the rendering of the oneiric — what does his cinema do that no other filmmaker's cinema does — and why does this contribution make him the reference artist for PHANTASMATA's Field II?
4. How do materialist surrealists (Švankmajer, Brothers Quay, Maddin) use the physical properties of their media — stop-motion animation, decayed film stock, haptic texture — to render dream as a tactile rather than purely visual experience, and what does this imply for PHANTASMATA's engagement with the material properties of digital media?
5. How do the memory-dream filmmakers (Resnais, Marker, Gondry, Kaufman) treat the boundary between memory and dream — are these the same state rendered differently, or different states with overlapping formal properties — and what does this distinction mean for PHANTASMATA works that deal with digital memory (cached files, browsing history, auto-saved drafts)?
6. How does the Japanese oneiric tradition (Kurosawa, Obayashi, Oshii, Kon) differ from the European and American traditions in its assumptions about the permeability of the boundary between waking and dream, and what formal techniques are specific to this tradition?
7. What is the specific challenge of rendering dream in found-digital formats — formats that are indexically committed to recording the real — and which techniques from the dream cinema tradition can be translated into found-digital vocabulary without betraying the format's documentary premise?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. The Surrealist Foundation (1929–1977)

#### Buñuel and Dalí: The Eye That Splits Open

The history of dream cinema begins with a razor blade. In the opening sequence of Un Chien Andalou (1929), Luis Buñuel sharpens a straight razor, steps onto a balcony, watches a thin cloud approach the full moon, and then — in an edit so precise it achieves the quality of inevitability — slices open a woman's eye as the cloud bisects the lunar disc. The image is ninety-seven years old and has lost none of its capacity to produce physical recoil. But the eye-slicing is not merely an act of surrealist provocation. It is a formal declaration: this cinema will cut open your organ of rational perception and replace what you see with what you dream.

Un Chien Andalou was produced according to the surrealist principle of automatism — the suppression of rational, aesthetic, or moral censorship in favor of the irrational associations of the unconscious. Buñuel and Dalí's working method, as reported by both, was to accept only images that could not be explained by rational means. "No idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted," Buñuel wrote. "We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us, without trying to explain why." The film's structure — a man drags two grand pianos loaded with dead donkeys across a room; ants emerge from a hole in a palm; a hand severed at the wrist lies in the street and is poked with a stick by an androgynous figure — is the result of this method. The images are not arbitrary (arbitrary images produce boredom, not dream); they are overdetermined, charged with the libidinal and aggressive energies that Freudian theory identifies as the raw material of dream-work. They are irrational but not meaningless. They mean too much rather than too little, and the surplus of meaning — the impossibility of fixing a single interpretation — is what gives them the texture of dream.

The formal innovation of Un Chien Andalou is not the content of its images but the logic of their connection. Each cut is an associative leap: the cloud crossing the moon triggers the eye-slicing, not because clouds cause blindness but because the visual rhyme (horizontal line crossing circular form) creates a connection that bypasses causal logic and operates at the level of visual association. This is the logic of dream as described by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900): condensation (multiple meanings compressed into a single image) and displacement (emotional charge transferred from its true object to a substitute). Buñuel and Dalí did not film a dream. They filmed according to the structural principles of dreaming, and the result is a film that produces in the waking viewer the specific cognitive state of dreaming: the sense that everything means something, that the connections are real but undecipherable, that the logic is operating just below the threshold of conscious comprehension.

L'Age d'Or (1930) extended the surrealist project into narrative, or anti-narrative: a film about desire — specifically, the desire of two lovers to consummate their passion — that is perpetually interrupted by the machinery of bourgeois civilization (the church, the state, polite society, cultural convention). The interruptions are rendered as surrealist eruptions: a cow on a bed, a gamekeeper who shoots his son for a minor annoyance, the Archbishop of Rome thrown out a window. The film's structure is paratactic rather than hypotactic — scenes are placed beside each other rather than subordinated to each other. There is no "main plot" into which the surrealist images are inserted as ornament. The surrealist images are the plot. The interruption is the narrative.

Late Buñuel represents the most formally sophisticated deployment of dream logic in narrative cinema. The Exterminating Angel (1962) presents a dinner party from which the guests cannot leave — not because the doors are locked but because the possibility of leaving has somehow been subtracted from reality. The premise is pure dream logic: the spatial impossibility that is never explained because, in a dream, the impossibility requires no explanation. It simply is. The film's claustrophobic repetition — guests attempting to leave, guests returning to their seats, the same gestures recurring with minor variations — maps the dream's characteristic structure of repetition-with-difference, the recursive loop that advances through variation rather than through linear progression.

The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) inverts the structure: instead of a dinner party that cannot end, it presents a dinner that cannot begin. Every attempt by a group of bourgeois friends to sit down to a meal is interrupted — by the restaurant owner's corpse in the back room, by military maneuvers, by terrorists, by the discovery that they are performing on a stage before an audience. The dream-within-dream structure is explicit: characters wake from dreams only to find themselves in other dreams, and the film provides no stable frame from which to determine which level is "real." The final image — the friends walking down a road toward a horizon they never reach — is the definitive image of the dream that cannot resolve because resolution would require waking, and waking is no longer available.

That Obscure Object of Desire (1977), Buñuel's final film, achieves identity instability through the simplest possible means: two different actresses (Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina) play the same character (Conchita) without acknowledgment or explanation. The film does not signal the substitution. It does not frame it as dream or hallucination. It presents it as fact: this character is played by two bodies, and the world in which this occurs does not notice or remark upon the impossibility. This is dream logic's most unsettling property — the dream-self accepts the impossible without surprise. The dreamer does not notice that the person they are speaking to has changed faces. Buñuel's cinema reproduces this acceptance in the viewer: you notice the substitution, but the film's refusal to acknowledge it makes you doubt whether the substitution is "really" happening or whether you are misperceiving a continuity that the film insists upon.

For PHANTASMATA, Buñuel's late work is more formally relevant than his early surrealist films. The early films — Un Chien Andalou, L'Age d'Or — are too visibly produced, too obviously staged, to map onto found-digital formats. But the late films' techniques — the impossible social situation (The Exterminating Angel), the dream-within-dream recursion (Discreet Charm), the identity substitution without acknowledgment (Obscure Object) — are translatable. A video-log in which the subject cannot leave the room, not because the door is locked but because leaving is simply never attempted, never considered. A screen-capture sequence in which the user wakes from a dream only to discover that the "waking" is another screen, another interface, another layer. A text-fragment in which the narrator refers to a person whose description subtly changes between paragraphs without comment. These are Buñuelian techniques in found-digital vocabulary.

#### Cocteau: The Mirror Between Worlds

Jean Cocteau's Orphic Trilogy — The Blood of a Poet (1930), Orphée (1950), and Testament of Orpheus (1960) — along with Beauty and the Beast (1946), constitutes the cinema's most sustained investigation of the threshold between worlds, and specifically of the mirror as the technology by which that threshold is crossed.

The Blood of a Poet established the mirror as portal in its second episode: the poet, trapped in a room with a living statue, is told that the only exit is through the mirror. He approaches the mirror, his hands enter the mercury-like surface, and he falls through into the Zone — a corridor of doors behind which impossible scenes play out. The technique is practical: Cocteau used a trough of water filmed from above, with the actor falling forward into it, then printed the footage to appear as a vertical surface. The effect is of a solid surface that becomes liquid at the moment of contact — the mirror that yields, that admits the dreamer into the space behind the reflection.

This technique — the liquid mirror — is Cocteau's definitive contribution to dream cinema's formal vocabulary. The mirror is the threshold between waking and dream, between life and death, between the visible world and the invisible world that Cocteau called "the Zone." The Zone is not a place in the ordinary sense; it is the space that exists in mirrors, the space that reflections inhabit, the space that the dreamer enters when the surface of the real becomes permeable. Cocteau's genius was to make this space filmable by making the threshold physical — by giving the crossing a material texture (liquid, mercury, water) that the camera could record.

Orphée (1950) refined the mirror technology and embedded it in a mythological narrative. Orpheus (Jean Marais) follows Death (Maria Casarès) through the mirror into the Zone, which is rendered as the bombed-out ruins of Saint-Cyr, filmed with high-contrast black and white that bleaches the space into a geography of light and shadow without depth or color. The Zone's inhabitants move in reverse: Cocteau simply reversed the footage, so that characters appear to walk backward, rubble rises from the ground, broken glass reassembles. This reversal — so simple technically, so devastating perceptually — is Cocteau's second major contribution: reverse motion as the signature of the otherworldly. In the Zone, time runs backward, not as a special effect but as the natural condition of a world that operates according to different laws. The dream-world is not the waking world with special effects added; it is the waking world with its temporal direction reversed.

Beauty and the Beast (1946), though not explicitly a dream film, deploys Cocteau's dream vocabulary in every frame of the Beast's castle. Arms emerge from walls to hold candelabras; eyes in the architecture follow Belle's movement; curtains billow without wind; doors open without being touched. These effects were achieved practically — actual human arms protruding through holes in the wall, actual stagehands pulling strings — and their materiality is crucial. The arms are real arms. The eyes are real eyes. The uncanny is produced not by the impossibility of the image but by the conjunction of the real (human flesh, human gaze) with the impossible (walls that have arms, architecture that sees). This is the tactile uncanny avant la lettre: the dream rendered not through visual trickery but through the physical presence of bodies in wrong positions.

For PHANTASMATA, Cocteau's contributions are threefold. First, the liquid mirror as threshold technology: the surface that yields, the screen that becomes permeable, the interface that admits the user into the space behind it. A screen-capture in which the user's reflection in a dark monitor appears to move independently. A video-log in which a glass surface — a window, a phone screen, a bathroom mirror — briefly shows a space that is not the space being reflected. Second, reverse motion as dream signature: footage that plays backward within otherwise forward-moving material, suggesting that the footage has crossed into a temporal Zone. A video-log in which a single gesture — a hand reaching for a door handle, a cup being set down — plays in reverse while everything else moves forward. Third, the practical uncanny: the real body in the wrong position, the human element that is physically present but positionally impossible. A video-log in which a hand appears at the edge of frame from a direction that no hand could reach — from inside a wall, from beneath a floor.

#### Deren: The Dream Mapped Before Anyone Else

Maya Deren's Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), made with her husband Alexander Hammid in their Hollywood bungalow with a budget effectively of nothing, is the most structurally precise dream-film ever made — and it mapped the formal structure of cinematic dream two decades before Buñuel's late masterpieces and three decades before Tarkovsky's Mirror.

The film's fourteen minutes contain the complete grammar of dream cinema. A woman (Deren herself) walks up a garden path, enters a house, and falls asleep in a chair. What follows is a dream — or rather, a recursive series of dream-iterations in which the same sequence of events (approaching the house, entering, climbing stairs, encountering objects) repeats with accumulating variations. A key, a knife, a cloaked figure with a mirror for a face, a flower on a path — these objects recur in each iteration, but their positions shift, their functions change, their significance mutates. In the first iteration, the key is on the path. In the second, the key falls from the dreamer's hand. In the third, the key becomes a knife. The transformation is not metaphorical — the key does not "represent" a knife. It becomes a knife, through the logic of the cut. One shot ends with a key in the hand; the next shot begins with a knife. The substitution is the cut's work, not the narrative's. Cinematic editing performs dream-work.

Deren's structural innovations can be catalogued with precision:

*Repetition with variation.* The same spatial trajectory (path, stairs, room, chair) recurs, but each recurrence introduces new elements or repositions existing ones. This maps the dream's characteristic structure: the sense that you have been here before, that this has happened before, but that something is different this time, and the difference is both unmistakable and undefinable.

*Spatial impossibility.* In one sequence, Deren places her foot on a series of different surfaces — the garden path, a rug, sand, grass, pavement — in consecutive steps. Each step lands in a different spatial context, but the continuity of the walking motion is unbroken. The body moves continuously; the space through which it moves is discontinuous. This is dream's spatial logic: you walk from one room and arrive in another that is not adjacent, not connected, not even in the same building, but the act of walking bridges the impossible gap without interruption.

*The temporal loop.* The film's structure is not linear (this happens, then this) or circular (the end returns to the beginning) but spiral: the end returns to a position near the beginning but displaced, elevated, transformed. The dreamer wakes — or appears to wake — but the waking is contaminated by the dream. The knife is on the bed. The mirror-faced figure is still present. The loop has advanced, not resolved.

*The object that transforms.* The key becomes a knife. The flower becomes a key. Objects in Deren's film are not stable; they shift identity through the cut, taking on new forms while retaining a residual charge from their previous forms. The knife that was a key carries the key's significance (access, opening, entry) into its new identity (violence, cutting, penetration). The transformation is not a metaphor imposed by interpretation; it is a formal event performed by the edit.

*The cloaked figure with the mirror face.* This figure — hooded, faceless, reflecting the dreamer's own image back at her — is the dream's representative within the dream: the presence that the dreamer encounters when she meets the mechanism of dreaming itself. The mirror-face does not reflect the external world; it reflects the dreamer. The dream shows you yourself, but the self it shows is occluded, cloaked, faceless — recognizable only as a reflection, not as a person.

For PHANTASMATA, Deren's Meshes is the single most important precursor text. It demonstrates that dream can be rendered with no budget, no special effects, no studio resources — only a camera, a body, a house, and an understanding of how editing performs the operations of dream-work. Every one of Deren's techniques is translatable into found-digital format. Repetition with variation: a video-log in which the same notification appears three times, each time with a different sender or a different message body. Spatial impossibility: a screen-capture that shows the same room from two angles that cannot coexist — a window that faces east in one shot and west in the next. The temporal loop: a video-log that appears to end and then restarts from a point near but not identical to its beginning, as if the file has corrupted into a loop. The transforming object: a text-fragment in which a key detail — a name, a date, a location — changes between paragraphs without acknowledgment. The mirror-faced figure: a video-log in which the face of the subject, briefly caught in a reflective surface, does not match the face the camera is recording.

### B2. The Materialist Surrealists (1964–present)

#### Švankmajer: Tactile Surrealism and the Animation of the Inanimate

Jan Švankmajer's cinema operates according to a principle that distinguishes it from every other tradition in this brief: the primacy of touch. Where Buñuel's surrealism is optical (the eye-slicing, the visual rhyme), where Cocteau's is spatial (the mirror, the Zone), and where Deren's is structural (the loop, the transformation), Švankmajer's is haptic — it makes the viewer feel textures through the eyes. His films are full of close-ups of surfaces: the grain of wood, the viscosity of clay, the roughness of bone, the dryness of sawdust, the sliminess of raw meat. These are not establishing shots or atmospheric details. They are the substance of the film's dream, which is a dream of being touched by objects — of the material world pressing itself against your skin with uncomfortable intimacy.

Švankmajer came to cinema through the Czech surrealist movement, which distinguished itself from Breton's Parisian surrealism in a crucial way: it was materialist. Where Parisian surrealism sought the marvelous in the mind (automatic writing, hypnotic trance, dream transcription), Czech surrealism sought it in objects — in the uncanny properties of things when they are removed from their functional contexts and encountered as pure physical presence. Švankmajer's artistic formation included work as a puppet maker, a sculptor, and a collector of natural curiosities, and these practices inform every frame of his films. His surrealism is not a surrealism of the image but a surrealism of the object — the thing that is present, that has weight, that resists and yields, that has a history written in its surfaces.

Alice (Neco z Alenky, 1988) is the paradigm. Švankmajer's adaptation of Carroll begins with a close-up of the actress Kristýna Kohoutová stating directly into the camera: "Alice thought to herself..." — establishing the film's frame as a thought, a dream, a mental event narrated by the dreamer. What follows is a dream rendered almost entirely through the animation of objects. The White Rabbit is a taxidermied rabbit in a glass case that comes to life, pulls nails from its feet, buttons a waistcoat, and checks a pocket watch. The rabbit is not a character in the narrative sense; it is an object that has been granted the properties of life without losing the properties of objecthood. It moves, but it moves as a dead thing would move if dead things could move — jerkily, with the stiffness of taxidermy, its glass eyes staring without sight. The uncanny is not that the rabbit is alive; it is that the rabbit is dead and alive simultaneously, that the boundary between animate and inanimate has been dissolved without resolving in favor of either term.

This is Švankmajer's fundamental operation: the animation of the inanimate. Stop-motion is his primary technique, but he does not use it to create the illusion of life (as Disney or Pixar do). He uses it to create the reality of the uncanny — to show objects moving in ways that are recognizable as movement but wrong in their quality, their tempo, their articulation. A sock wriggles across a floor like a caterpillar. A piece of raw meat crawls. Stones arrange themselves into patterns. The movement is not lifelike; it is deathlike — movement that has the grammar of life but the texture of death. This is the definitive uncanny: not the living thing that appears dead (the corpse) but the dead thing that appears alive (the puppet, the automaton, the animated object).

Faust (Lekce Faust, 1994) extends this operation into the human body. The film intercuts live-action footage of a contemporary Prague businessman with stop-motion puppet sequences in which the same narrative plays out on a miniature stage. The transitions between live action and animation are not marked — a live-action hand reaches for a door, and the next frame shows a puppet hand grasping a puppet door. The human body and the puppet body occupy the same narrative position, and the film's refusal to hierarchize them (the human is not "real" and the puppet "symbolic"; both are equally present, equally material, equally strange) produces the specific dream-sensation of being simultaneously in your body and watching your body from outside.

Conspirators of Pleasure (Spiklenci slasti, 1996) is almost wordless — a film of pure tactile ritual in which six characters construct elaborate fetish objects (a machine made of bread rolls, a papier-mache figure, fur-covered balls, a mechanical device) and use them in secret ceremonies of self-pleasuring. The film is simultaneously comic and deeply disturbing because the rituals are rendered with the attentive precision of documentary: every fold of paper, every application of paste, every stitch of fabric is shown in close-up with the care of a craft demonstration. The banality of the materials (bread, newspaper, straw) and the extremity of the desire they serve produce a dissonance that is specifically oneiric — the dream's tendency to invest ordinary objects with unbearable libidinal charge.

The Czech context is inseparable from Švankmajer's surrealism. Under Soviet occupation, Czech surrealism was both an artistic movement and a form of political resistance. The communist regime demanded socialist realism — art that reflected the official version of material reality. Surrealism, by definition, refused this demand. The irrational was the only free territory because the regime could not legislate the contents of the unconscious. Švankmajer's films were periodically banned (he was forbidden from filmmaking for seven years in the 1970s), and this suppression is formally legible: his cinema has the compressed intensity of expression that must find indirect routes, the density of a communication that cannot afford to be explicit. The dream, for Švankmajer, is not an escape from reality but the only mode of reality that the state cannot fully control.

For PHANTASMATA, Švankmajer's contribution is the principle of tactile horror — the dream rendered through the physical properties of material rather than through visual illusion. This translates into found-digital format through the material properties of digital media itself: compression artifacts that make surfaces look "wrong," frame rates that make movement stutter like stop-motion, audio that has the texture of being recorded too close to the microphone (breath, lip sounds, the physicality of the voice). A video-log in which the visual quality degrades not into static (that would be analog) but into the specific textures of digital compression — blocky artifacts, smeared colors, the uncanny smoothness of over-processed skin. An audio-log in which the closeness of the microphone makes every sound tactile — the moisture of speech, the scrape of fabric, the faint wheeze of respiration. These are Švankmajer's principles (the haptic, the material, the too-close) translated into the material vocabulary of digital recording.

#### The Brothers Quay: Miniature Worlds of Dust and Breath

Stephen and Timothy Quay, identical twins born in Philadelphia and based in London since 1979, have spent four decades building miniature worlds — sets no larger than a tabletop, populated by handmade puppets, animated frame by frame under lighting conditions that produce a permanent twilight. Their cinema is a cinema of the very small: screws, pins, cotton thread, dust, rust, splintered wood, tarnished metal. The camera moves through these miniature worlds with the slowness of exploration, discovering details that are simultaneously precise (every splinter is in focus, every mote of dust is visible) and illegible (what are we looking at? what is this space? what is this object?). The Quays' dream is not a dream of vast landscapes or cosmic spectacle; it is a dream of the overlooked — the forgotten drawer, the back of the cabinet, the space behind the wallpaper where things accumulate unseen.

Street of Crocodiles (1986), based on Bruno Schulz's fiction, is their masterwork: a thirty-minute film in which a puppet — a figure of wood, cloth, and thread — wanders through a labyrinth of chambers, corridors, and vitrines populated by objects that move with apparent autonomy. Screws unscrew themselves from wood and roll across tables. A piece of raw meat quivers on a plate. Bolts of fabric unfurl and wrap themselves around the puppet's body. The puppet's world is a world in which objects have desires — they want to move, to arrange themselves, to touch the puppet — and this animation of desire in inanimate matter is the Quays' version of the uncanny. It is related to Švankmajer's animation of the inanimate but differs in its emotional register: where Švankmajer's animated objects are aggressive, hungry, predatory, the Quays' animated objects are melancholic, yearning, reaching out with the desperate gentleness of things that want to be noticed.

The Quays' specific contribution to dream cinema is what the film theorist Laura Marks has called the "haptic image" — an image that appeals to the sense of touch rather than the sense of sight. The haptic image is characterized by closeness (the camera is very near the surface), texture (the surface is rendered in such detail that it seems to possess physical grain), and ambiguity (the closeness and texture make it difficult to identify the object, so the viewer's eye moves across the surface rather than through it to a represented object). The Quays' cinematography is consistently haptic: their camera is always too close, the focus is always on the surface rather than the object, the lighting always emphasizes texture over form. The viewer's eye does not look at things; it moves across things, feeling their surfaces with the proxy of vision.

Institute Benjamenta (1995), their only live-action feature, translates the miniature world into human scale but retains the haptic principle. The film, based on Robert Walser's novel Jakob von Gunten, takes place in an institute for servants where the lessons consist of a single exercise repeated endlessly. The live-action spaces are filmed with the same closeness, the same attention to surface, the same twilight luminosity as the miniature worlds. Actors move through corridors with the deliberation of puppets. Their gestures are precise but slightly mechanical, as if they have been animated frame by frame and the illusion of continuous movement is imperfect. The result is an oneiric space in which the human body becomes an object — not dehumanized but re-materialized, made present as a physical thing with weight, texture, and surface.

The Quays' films are almost impossible to narrate because their content is texture rather than event. Nothing "happens" in Street of Crocodiles in the narrative sense — there is no plot, no conflict, no resolution. What happens is that dust falls, screws turn, light shifts, surfaces are revealed. The dream is not a story but an environment — a space that the viewer inhabits through the proxy of vision, feeling its textures, sensing its temperatures, aware of its decay. This is the dream not as narrative but as place — the dream as a room you are in rather than a story you are told.

For PHANTASMATA, the Quays' contribution is the principle of the haptic digital — the found-digital output that emphasizes texture, closeness, and surface over narrative content. A video-log shot in extreme close-up on a phone camera, the lens so close to surfaces that they become abstract: the grain of a desk, the weave of fabric, the pattern of condensation on glass. An audio-log in which the microphone is placed inside an enclosed space — a drawer, a cabinet, a box — so that the ambient sound has the claustrophobic intimacy of being inside something. A screen-capture in which the cursor moves slowly across a surface — a desktop wallpaper, a high-resolution photograph, a satellite map — not clicking, not opening anything, just moving, the cursor's motion becoming the viewer's proxy for touch. These are the Quays' haptic principles translated into the sensory vocabulary of digital recording.

#### Jodorowsky: The Body as Symbolic Surface

Alejandro Jodorowsky — born in Chile to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants, raised in the Chilean circus, trained in Marcel Marceau's mime school, associated with the Panic movement alongside Arrabal and Topor, resident of Mexico and France — makes films in which the human body is the primary surface of symbolic inscription. His characters are painted, tattooed, mutilated, disfigured, transformed, and reassembled. They wear their meanings on their skin. The dream, in Jodorowsky, is not a state of consciousness but a state of the body — a condition in which the body's surface becomes a screen for the projection of psychic and spiritual content.

El Topo (1970) is the foundational midnight movie — the film that invented the concept of the midnight screening when it ran at the Elgin Cinema in New York for six consecutive months. The film follows a gunfighter (Jodorowsky) through a desert that functions as both literal landscape and psychic topography. He defeats four master gunfighters (each of whom represents a spiritual tradition), is shot and left for dead, is reborn in a cave populated by deformed outcasts, and attempts to liberate them. The narrative follows the structure of a tarot reading — Jodorowsky is a practitioner of psychomagic and tarot, and his narrative structures are derived from the tarot's major arcana rather than from conventional dramatic structure. Each "act" corresponds to a card: the Fool's journey, the encounters with the Empress, the Hierophant, the Tower, Death, Judgment. This is dream-narrative in the most literal sense: narrative that operates according to symbolic rather than causal logic, where events follow not from what happened before but from what the symbolic structure requires next.

The Holy Mountain (1973) escalates the symbolic register into cosmic satire. A Christ-like thief (Horacio Salinas) ascends a tower to meet the Alchemist (Jodorowsky), who assembles a group of powerful industrialists — each associated with a planet, a color, a vice, a body part — and leads them on a journey to the Holy Mountain where the Secret of Immortality is supposedly guarded. The film's visual vocabulary is maximalist: every frame is loaded with symbolic objects, painted bodies, ritual tableaux, architectural impossibilities. The Holy Mountain does not render dream through any of the formal techniques catalogued above (associative cutting, spatial impossibility, temporal loops). It renders dream through density of signification — through the simple fact that every visible surface is charged with symbolic meaning, and the accumulation of meanings produces the dream's characteristic sensory overload, the feeling that the world means more than you can process.

Santa Sangre (1989), Jodorowsky's most narratively coherent film, renders the oneiric through the body's literal fragmentation. Fenix (Axel Jodorowsky, the director's son) is a young man whose armless mother (Blanca Guerra) uses his arms as her own — standing behind him, directing his hands, making him perform the gestures she cannot make. This image — the son as the mother's prosthesis, the body shared between two identities — is dream-imagery of the most concentrated kind. It is the dream of the body that is not entirely yours, the dream of being moved by another's will, the dream of the puppet. The film's murders — committed by Fenix/his mother in a state of dissociative fusion — are dream-murders: acts performed by a subject who is not fully present in his own body, whose agency is distributed across two bodies, whose identity is a composite.

Jodorowsky's contribution to dream cinema is the principle of the body as symbolic surface — the body that is not a container for character but a screen for projection, a surface on which meanings are inscribed, painted, tattooed, mutilated, and displayed. This is the dream body: not the body as it is experienced in waking life (functional, transparent, a tool for navigating the world) but the body as it is experienced in dream (opaque, significant, charged with meaning, subject to transformation).

For PHANTASMATA, Jodorowsky's principle translates into the marked body in found-digital format. The video-log in which the subject's face or hands bear marks — bruises, writing, paint, temporary tattoos — that appear without explanation and change between uploads. The mock-post in which profile pictures show progressive bodily alteration — hair loss, skin discoloration, weight change, scarification — without the poster's acknowledgment. The text-fragment in which the narrator describes their body as a surface being written on by an unknown agent. These are Jodorowsky's body-as-screen principles translated into the exhibitionist vocabulary of social media, where the body is already a surface of self-presentation and symbolic inscription.

#### Guy Maddin: Memory as Decayed Film Stock

Guy Maddin, working from Winnipeg, Manitoba — a city he treats as both biographical fact and mythological landscape — has produced a body of work that renders memory-as-dream through the most literal possible means: by making his films look like they are remembered. His films are shot on Super 8 and 16mm, processed with deliberate degradation (overexposure, chemical staining, light leaks), edited with the jumpiness of early cinema (missing frames, iris transitions, intertitles), and scored with the melodramatic intensity of silent-film accompaniment. They look like films that have been found in an attic, screened on a damaged projector, and remembered imperfectly by someone who saw them decades ago. The material degradation of the film stock is not an aesthetic choice in the decorative sense; it is a formal vocabulary for rendering the degradation of memory.

Brand Upon the Brain! (2006) is Maddin's most fully realized deployment of this vocabulary. The film presents the adult Guy Maddin (narrator) revisiting the lighthouse where he grew up, and his "memories" of childhood — a childhood populated by orphans used for scientific experiments, a teenage detective disguised as a boy, a tyrannical mother who communicates through a megaphone, and a father who keeps a mysterious device in the lighthouse. The memories are rendered in the silent-film vocabulary of Maddin's signature style: black and white, iris transitions, melodramatic intertitles, expressionist lighting, actors performing with the heightened gestural vocabulary of silent-era cinema. But the film's innovation is that the memories are explicitly unreliable — they are too dramatic, too perfectly structured, too satisfyingly resolved to be actual memories. They are memories as the dreaming mind reworks them: intensified, narrativized, reshaped into the forms of the films that have colonized the rememberer's imagination.

My Winnipeg (2007) makes the memory-dream-cinema feedback loop explicit. The film is a "docu-fantasia" in which Maddin narrates his relationship with his hometown while staging reenactments of his childhood using actors in his mother's actual house. The reenactments are presented as memories, but they are visible staged. The staging is presented as documentary, but it is visibly fictional. The memories are presented as autobiography, but they are visibly mythologized. The film's formal achievement is to make all three registers — memory, staging, documentary — simultaneously operative and mutually contaminating. You cannot watch My Winnipeg and separate the "real" Winnipeg from the "remembered" Winnipeg from the "filmed" Winnipeg, because Maddin demonstrates that for a filmmaker, these three are the same thing. Memory is already a film. Film is already a memory. And both are already dreams.

The Forbidden Room (2015) applies the degraded-film vocabulary at industrial scale: a nested-narrative structure in which stories contain stories contain stories, each rendered in a different style of deliberately degraded film stock. The outermost narrative takes place on a submarine; within it, a woodsman tells a story that contains a volcano-cult narrative that contains a medical case study that contains a dream sequence that contains another film. The degradation intensifies with each level of nesting: the outermost narrative has the visual quality of a well-preserved silent film; the innermost narratives are barely visible through chemical stains, light leaks, and emulsion damage. The film renders the depth of dream — the dream-within-dream-within-dream — as the progressive deterioration of the recording medium. The deeper you go into the dream, the worse the image quality becomes, because the deeper memory is the more degraded memory, the memory that has been stored longest, replayed most often, damaged most thoroughly by the passage of time.

For PHANTASMATA, Maddin's contribution is the principle of material degradation as dream-vocabulary — the idea that the physical (or digital) condition of the recording medium can encode the oneiric quality of the content. This translates into found-digital format with precision: a video-log whose visual quality deteriorates over its duration, not through analog artifacts (that would be Maddin's vocabulary) but through digital ones — increasing compression, lower resolution, color-space collapse, the specific visual texture of a file that has been compressed, uploaded, downloaded, re-compressed, and re-uploaded until the image has lost most of its information. This is the digital equivalent of generation loss: the dream that has been copied so many times that the original is irrecoverable. An audio-log that has been "found" on an old phone, and whose quality reflects the age of the device — lower sample rate, mono recording, the specific flatness of early smartphone microphones. A text-fragment that appears to have been through multiple format conversions — smart quotes replaced by question marks, line breaks in wrong places, encoding errors that turn accented characters into garbage — the textual equivalent of Maddin's chemical stains and light leaks.

### B3. Tarkovsky and the Oneiric: Why He Is the Reference Artist

#### The Thesis: Duration as Dream

Andrei Tarkovsky rejected the label "surrealist." He regarded surrealism as an imposition of the artist's will upon reality — an artificial construction that substituted the artist's private symbolism for the world's own meanings. His method was the opposite: not to construct dream-imagery but to observe reality with such patience and attention that reality itself began to dream. "The image is not a certain meaning, expressed by the director, but an entire world reflected as in a drop of water," he wrote in Sculpting in Time (1967/1986). The drop of water is not a metaphor; it is a method. Tarkovsky's camera watches water — falling, flowing, pooling, reflecting, transforming what it touches — and in watching water, it enters the oneiric.

This is why Tarkovsky is PHANTASMATA's reference artist. Not because his films contain dream sequences (though they do), but because his films demonstrate that the oneiric is not a genre of content but a quality of attention. Dream does not require surrealist imagery, special effects, or narrative trickery. It requires duration — the willingness to look at something long enough that the thing begins to change, to reveal latent properties, to become luminous and strange. A puddle on a factory floor, filmed for ninety seconds, becomes a portal. A room where it rains indoors, observed without urgency, becomes a state of consciousness rather than a physical location. Tarkovsky's cinema proves that any image, held long enough, becomes oneiric — because duration itself alters perception, and altered perception is the definition of dream.

#### Mirror (Zerkalo, 1975): The Definitive Oneiric Film

Mirror is the film that PHANTASMATA's creative production must ultimately answer to — not as a model to be imitated but as a standard of oneiric integrity against which its outputs can be measured. The film has no conventional narrative. It is structured as an assemblage of three temporal registers — Tarkovsky's childhood (rendered in saturated, mythic color), his present (rendered in desaturated, wintry tones), and documentary newsreel footage (black and white, archival grain) — cut together according to associative rather than chronological logic. A memory of a barn burning triggers a cut to newsreel footage of wartime evacuation, which triggers a cut to a present-day conversation that echoes a childhood dialogue, which triggers a cut to the wind moving through grass in a landscape that could be childhood or present or neither.

The film's structural principle is the dream's structural principle: association. Events do not follow each other because they are causally connected; they follow each other because they are emotionally resonant. The barn fire and the wartime evacuation share an emotional charge (loss, destruction, displacement) rather than a causal link. The childhood dialogue and the present conversation share a tonal quality (the weight of unspoken accusation) rather than a narrative connection. The wind through grass connects to other wind-images throughout the film (curtains billowing, pages turning, hair stirring) through visual rhyme rather than through plot. The viewer experiences Mirror the way a dreamer experiences a dream: by following the flow of association, surrendering the demand for causal explanation, and trusting that the connections are real even when they cannot be articulated.

The recurring images — wind, fire, water, levitation, the mother's face (played by Margarita Terekhova, who also plays the wife, doubling the temporal registers through bodily identity just as Buñuel doubled Conchita through bodily difference) — function not as symbols to be decoded but as nodes of condensation. Each image accumulates meaning through repetition: the wind is the wind of childhood, the wind of the present, the wind that turns the pages of a book, the wind that announces the arrival of a visitor who never comes. It does not "mean" any single thing; it means all of its occurrences simultaneously, and the accumulation of meanings produces the overdetermination characteristic of dream images. The dream image is not one-to-one (this means that); it is one-to-many (this means everything it has ever appeared with), and the surplus of meaning is what gives it its emotional weight.

Mirror's sound design is equally oneiric. Tarkovsky uses diegetic sound — the creak of a door, the drip of water, the rustle of fabric — with the heightened clarity of dream-hearing, where ordinary sounds are perceived as significant, portentous, charged with meaning they do not carry in waking life. The door's creak is not ambient noise; it is an event, a punctuation, a transition marker between states of consciousness. The film also incorporates Arseny Tarkovsky's poetry, read in the poet's own voice — the father's words entering the son's dream of the mother, creating a triangulation of absence (the absent father is present as voice; the absent mother is present as image; the absent past is present as poetry) that is structurally identical to the dream's management of absent persons. In dreams, the dead speak. In Mirror, they speak in verse.

For PHANTASMATA: Mirror's structural principle — associative editing governed by emotional resonance rather than narrative causality — is directly translatable into found-digital format. A series of video-logs that do not tell a linear story but are connected by recurring visual elements (a particular shade of light, a specific background sound, a gesture that recurs across different locations and different "found" sources). The viewer assembles the connection not through narrative comprehension but through pattern recognition — the same cognitive operation that the dreamer performs when assembling meaning from the dream's associative flow. The individual video-logs need not explain their connection to each other; the emotional and visual resonance is the connection.

#### Stalker (1979): The Zone as Threshold Space

Stalker is the cinema's most sustained investigation of the threshold between ordinary reality and the oneiric. The Zone — a cordoned-off territory where the normal laws of physics and causality are suspended, created by some unspecified event (a meteorite, an alien visitation) — is not a dream space in the literal sense. Characters enter it while awake. They move through it with physical bodies. They experience it with sensory apparatus that the film treats as reliable. But the Zone behaves like a dream: its geography shifts, its paths change, its dangers are unpredictable and apparently responsive to the psychological state of the person moving through it. "The Zone is a very complicated system of traps," the Stalker warns. "It lets those pass who have lost all hope." The Zone's selectivity — it responds to interior states, not exterior actions — is the dream's selectivity. The dream admits you on its terms, not yours.

The film's formal rendering of the Zone is achieved not through visual spectacle (the Zone looks like an ordinary landscape — meadows, ruins, water, vegetation) but through duration and texture. The camera moves through the Zone in long tracking shots that observe the ground with the attention of a naturalist: pools of water, rusted metal, scattered objects (syringes, coins, religious icons, engine parts), plant life growing through concrete. The accumulation of detail, observed at the pace of walking, produces a heightened perceptual state in the viewer — the state of noticing everything, of investing every visible surface with potential significance. This is the oneiric achieved through duration: not by showing impossible things but by looking at possible things long enough that they become impossible to take for granted.

The sepia-to-color transition is Stalker's most discussed formal device. The world outside the Zone is rendered in desaturated sepia; the Zone itself is rendered in color. The transition occurs without announcement — a cut that happens to cross the boundary. The color does not signify "beauty" or "nature" or "freedom" in any simple allegorical sense. It signifies a change in reality-register — the shift from one mode of perception to another, from the waking world's impoverished palette to the dream's full chromatic spectrum. The reverse transition (color to sepia) occurs when the characters return from the Zone, and the return to desaturation is experienced as loss — the loss of perceptual richness, the loss of significance, the return to a world where things are only what they are.

The Room — the heart of the Zone, the place that supposedly grants the visitor's deepest wish — is never entered. The three characters (the Stalker, the Writer, the Professor) approach it, sit at its threshold, and ultimately decline to enter. This refusal is the film's oneiric climax: the dream that offers its deepest revelation and is declined, not because the dreamer lacks courage but because the dreamer recognizes that the revelation — the deepest wish, which may not be the conscious wish but the unconscious one — might be unbearable. The Room is the Zone's mirror: it reflects not what you want but what you are, and the prospect of that reflection is the film's terror.

Tarkovsky's water in Stalker deserves separate attention because it constitutes a sustained formal argument about the material substrate of dream. Water is everywhere in the Zone: pools, puddles, streams, rain, underwater objects. The camera is frequently positioned at water level, looking across surfaces that reflect and distort the world above. These water-level shots produce a specific visual effect: the real world (above the water) and its reflection (in the water) coexist in the frame, and the boundary between them — the water's surface — is mobile, trembling, responsive to wind and motion. This is dream rendered as material condition: the surface between the real and its double is liquid, permeable, and always moving. Dream is not an alternative to reality; it is reality's reflection in a surface that will not hold still.

#### Nostalghia (1983) and The Sacrifice (Offret, 1986)

Nostalghia extends the Zone concept into the condition of exile. The Russian poet Gorchakov, traveling in Italy, experiences the Italian landscape as a dream of Russia — every pool of water reflects a Russian landscape, every fog evokes a Russian winter, every encounter with Italian beauty triggers a memory of Russian suffering. The film's formal innovation is the superimposition shot in which the Russian dacha (Gorchakov's childhood home) appears inside an Italian cathedral — the childhood memory literally occupying the adult space, the dream inserting itself into the architecture of the present. This is not a dissolve (one image fading into another) but a coexistence: both spaces are fully present, fully lit, fully dimensional, occupying the same frame without merging. The oneiric is not a replacement of reality but an addition to it — a second reality layered onto the first, visible to the dreamer but not to the other inhabitants of the space.

The candle-carrying sequence — Gorchakov's attempt to cross the empty pool of Bagno Vignoni while keeping a candle lit, filmed in a single unbroken take of approximately nine minutes — is the definitive statement of durational dream-rendering. The task is absurd: carry a lit candle across a drained mineral pool without letting it go out. The wind keeps extinguishing it. Gorchakov keeps relighting it and starting over. The camera follows without cutting. The duration is real — there are no ellipses, no compressions, no escape from the time of the crossing. The viewer watches every step, every flicker, every failure, every resumption. And in the watching, the mundane task (carrying a candle) becomes transcendent — not because Tarkovsky adds transcendence (there is no music, no visual embellishment, no narrative commentary) but because duration itself transforms the ordinary into the oneiric. Nine minutes of watching a man carry a candle across a pool is long enough that the act ceases to be an act and becomes a state — a state of consciousness in which the viewer is no longer watching someone else perform but is somehow performing the crossing themselves, their breath synchronized with the candle's flame, their anxiety about the flame's survival indistinguishable from Gorchakov's. Duration abolishes the distance between viewer and viewed, and the abolition of distance is the condition of dream: in dream, you do not watch events from outside. You are in them.

The Sacrifice achieves the dream-within-life structure through the famous house-burning sequence: a single take in which Alexander's house, which he has promised to God as a sacrifice, is set ablaze and burns completely while the camera observes from a fixed position and family members attempt to restrain Alexander. The take lasted six and a half minutes. On the first attempt, the camera jammed; the house had to be rebuilt and reburned. The materiality of this — the real fire, the real house, the real destruction, the real camera malfunction and its real consequences — is integral to the oneiric effect. Tarkovsky does not simulate the sacrifice; he performs it. The house really burns. The film really captures its destruction. The destruction is irreversible — the house cannot be unburned, the footage cannot be un-shot. This indexical commitment to the real event is what gives it its dream quality: the dream that this is really happening, that the destruction is actual, that you are watching something that cannot be taken back.

**Why Tarkovsky is Field II's reference artist — a synthesis:**

Tarkovsky demonstrates that dream can be rendered through patience, texture, and material rather than through spectacle, trickery, or digital construction. His cinema is the proof that the oneiric does not require surrealist shock (Buñuel's eye-slicing), spatial impossibility (Deren's discontinuous steps), or narrative recursion (Kaufman's nested frames). It requires only attention — attention sustained long enough that the object of attention transforms. This is directly relevant to PHANTASMATA because the project's found-digital formats are, by definition, indexical — they record what is in front of the camera, on the screen, in the microphone. They cannot stage impossibilities without betraying their found-digital premise. But they can sustain attention. A video-log that holds a shot of an ordinary room for three minutes while nothing happens is, by Tarkovsky's logic, oneiric — because the duration transforms the room from a space into a state, from a location into a condition of consciousness, from something you see into something you inhabit. PHANTASMATA's oneiric register is Tarkovskian: not the dream of impossible things but the dream of ordinary things perceived with impossible attention.

### B4. Memory as Dream (1961–2021)

#### Resnais: The Architecture of Impossible Memory

Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad (L'Année dernière à Marienbad, 1961), scripted by Alain Robbe-Grillet, is the most formally rigorous dream-film in cinema history — and the film about which the question "is this a dream?" is most radically unanswerable. A man (X) tells a woman (A) that they met last year at Marienbad and that she agreed to leave with him. She denies it. He insists. The film does not resolve the dispute. Instead, it presents multiple, mutually contradictory versions of the past: scenes that may be memories, may be fantasies, may be persuasion-attempts, may be projections of desire. The baroque hotel in which the action takes place — with its endless corridors, its formal gardens, its frozen tableaux of elegantly dressed guests — functions as a memory palace in the mnemonic tradition: a space whose architecture encodes the structure of recollection, with each room containing a different version of the past.

Resnais' formal techniques constitute a vocabulary of impossible memory:

*The frozen gesture.* Characters in Marienbad periodically freeze in mid-action — a woman's hand suspended over a glass, a man's arm extended in a gesture that never completes — while the narration continues. The freeze is not a pause (a pause implies resumption); it is a crystallization. The moment is removed from the temporal flow and held, examined, turned over. This is the memory's tendency to isolate moments — to extract a gesture from its temporal context and preserve it as a still image, a snapshot, a single frame removed from the sequence. The frozen gesture is the formal representation of how memory actually works: not as continuous playback but as the preservation of isolated instants.

*The impossible geometry.* The gardens at Marienbad are formal, symmetrical, precisely ordered — but the characters' shadows fall in directions inconsistent with any single light source, and the topiary's shadows are present while the characters' shadows are absent. This is not a continuity error; it is a formal choice. The space is geometrically precise but physically impossible. It is a space that could exist in a memory or a persuasion but not in a physical reality governed by consistent laws of light. The impossible geometry is the formal representation of memory's tendency to reconstruct spaces with architectural precision while getting the physics wrong — the room remembered in exact detail but with the window on the wrong wall, the garden remembered with every path in place but under a light that never existed.

*The organ music.* Marienbad's score (by Francis Seyrig) is dominated by organ music — sustained, reverberant, filling the baroque spaces with a sonic presence that is simultaneously sacred and oppressive. The organ's reverb is the acoustic equivalent of the hotel's architecture: both create spaces that are too large, too resonant, too empty. The organ does not accompany the narrative; it replaces it. In sequences where the organ dominates, the narrative voice falls silent, and the film enters a purely formal register in which architecture, sound, and gesture constitute the entire content. This is the dream's soundscape: not silence (dreams have sound) but a sound that is too present, too all-encompassing, too much — the sonic equivalent of the visual overdetermination that characterizes dream.

Muriel, ou le Temps d'un retour (Muriel, or the Time of Return, 1963) applies Resnais' memory-dream vocabulary to a specific historical trauma: the French use of torture during the Algerian War. The title character, Muriel, never appears; she is the Algerian woman whom Bernard (Jean-Pierre Kérien) tortured during his military service, and whose name he cannot stop speaking though he cannot speak what the name designates. Bernard has filmed his experience in Algeria on an amateur camera, and the footage — never shown in full, glimpsed in fragments — is the film's absent center, the document that would resolve the memory's ambiguity but that remains withheld. The documentary footage of real trauma, circulating as fragments within a fictional narrative about the impossibility of integrating that trauma into present-tense life, is a structure that PHANTASMATA's found-digital formats are designed to reproduce: the fragment of "real" footage embedded in a constructed frame, producing the specific dread of not knowing what is real and what is fabrication.

#### Chris Marker: The Photo-Roman as Dream-Form

Chris Marker's La Jetée (1962) is constructed almost entirely from still photographs — black and white stills, narrated in voice-over, with a single moment of moving image (the woman in bed opens her eyes). The form is the content: memory is made of still images, not of continuous footage. The brain does not store experience as video; it stores it as snapshots, and the narrative that connects the snapshots is reconstructed each time the memory is accessed. La Jetée renders this reconstructive process visible by presenting its narrative (a time-travel story in which a man is sent from a post-apocalyptic future into the past, drawn by the memory of a woman's face seen on the observation deck at Orly Airport) as a sequence of stills that the viewer's perceptual system stitches into apparent continuity.

The single moment of motion — the woman's eyes opening, a few seconds of genuine film — is devastating because it breaks the still-image contract. The viewer has been processing stills as pseudo-motion for twenty-five minutes, and the sudden intrusion of actual motion is experienced as a rupture in the medium's reality. The woman's eyes open, and the film itself seems to wake up. The implication is that within the dream of memory (the stills), there is one moment of genuine presence (the motion), and that moment — the moment when the dreamer is most fully in the past, most fully alive in the memory — is the moment when the dream becomes real. Or, equivalently, when reality becomes a dream.

Sans Soleil (1983) extends the photo-roman principle into the essay film: a meditation on memory, image, and the relationship between seeing and remembering, structured as a series of letters from a fictional cameraman (Sandor Krasna) read by a female narrator. The film moves between Japan, Guinea-Bissau, Iceland, and San Francisco without geographical or chronological logic — the movement is associative, governed by visual and thematic rhymes rather than by itinerary. Images from Japanese television bleed into images of African ritual; a cat shrine in Tokyo connects to a ritual celebration in Bissau through the logic of animism rather than the logic of geography. The film demonstrates that memory is not an archive (stored in order, retrievable by date) but a network (stored by association, retrievable by resonance) — and that the network's structure is the structure of dream.

For PHANTASMATA, Marker's contributions are two. First, the still image as dream-material: the screen-capture, the screenshot, the saved image — the still taken from a continuous flow and preserved as a fragment of arrested time. A PHANTASMATA screen-capture sequence that presents a series of screenshots — taken from different apps, different times, different contexts — narrated by a voice that stitches them into an associative sequence, is a direct application of La Jetée's form in found-digital vocabulary. Second, the essay-film as oneiric structure: the text-fragment that moves between topics according to associative logic, without transition or explanation, trusting that the resonances between the fragments will produce meaning that sequential argument cannot.

#### Kubrick: Eyes Wide Shut as Dream-Walk

Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut (1999), is the most sustained rendering of the waking dream in mainstream cinema. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) spends a night wandering through New York after his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) confesses a sexual fantasy about another man. The confession is the dream's inciting event — the disruption of the stable reality (their marriage, their identity as a couple) that opens the door to the oneiric. Everything that follows — Bill's encounters with a dead patient's daughter who declares her love, a prostitute who may or may not have HIV, a costume shop owner who pimps his underage daughter, and ultimately the Somerton mansion's ritualized orgy — has the quality of dream: each encounter is too precisely calibrated to Bill's psychological state (sexual anxiety, masculine insecurity, class aspiration) to be coincidence, and too physically real to be hallucination.

Kubrick achieves this quality through three formal means. First, the lighting: every interior in Eyes Wide Shut is lit with practical Christmas lights, giving every space a warm, diffuse, slightly unreal glow that is neither daylight nor artificial light but something between them — the light of a space that is almost, but not quite, real. Second, the geography: Bill wanders through a New York that was filmed entirely on soundstages at Pinewood Studios in England. The streets are recognizable as New York but slightly wrong — too clean, too empty, too perfectly composed. The geographical imposture (London pretending to be New York) produces a spatial uncanny that operates below conscious recognition: you know these streets, but something about them is displaced, shifted, rearranged. Third, the symmetry: Kubrick's compositions in Eyes Wide Shut are aggressively symmetrical — doorways centered, corridors aligned, figures placed with bilateral precision. This symmetry is the formal signature of the dream's tendency to impose order on the chaotic — the dream that is too perfectly organized, too precisely balanced, too aesthetically controlled to be waking reality.

The Somerton sequence — the masked ritual in the Long Island mansion — is the film's oneiric centerpiece. Bill gains entry using a password ("Fidelio"), dons a mask and cloak, and witnesses a ceremony in which robed figures circle a high priest who ceremonially undresses masked women to the accompaniment of a liturgical chant (Jocelyn Pook's "Masked Ball," built from a Romanian Orthodox liturgy played backward). The sequence operates according to dream logic at every level: the space is too vast, the ritual too elaborate, the participants too numerous, the danger too precisely calibrated to Bill's desire (to see, to penetrate, to be admitted to the secret). It is the dream of the excluded: the dream of finding the door, knowing the password, entering the room where the secret is kept. And like all such dreams, it ends in exposure — Bill is unmasked, challenged, threatened — because the dream of admission always contains the dream of ejection. The dreamer who enters the forbidden room must eventually be discovered, because the dream's function is not to grant access but to produce the experience of transgression.

The film's final word — "fuck" — spoken by Alice in response to Bill's question about what they should do now that the night is over, is the awakening. It is the body's reassertion after the mind's nocturnal wandering. It is the waking world's blunt materiality after the dream's elaborate choreography. It is the word that cannot exist in the dream (too direct, too physical, too present) and therefore signals that the dream is over.

For PHANTASMATA, Eyes Wide Shut's contribution is the dream-walk: the found-digital equivalent of Bill's wandering. A video-log that follows a subject walking through a city at night, encountering situations that are too precisely responsive to the subject's psychological state — too coincidental, too symbolic, too perfectly staged — to be documentary. The video-log does not announce itself as dream; it presents itself as a record of a walk. But the walk's content is oneiric: every encounter means something, every detail is charged, every space is slightly too beautiful or slightly too threatening. The viewer cannot determine whether the subject is recording reality or constructing a performance that imitates reality's structure while replacing its content.

#### Gondry: Memory Erasure and In-Camera Dream

Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004, written by Charlie Kaufman) achieves its oneiric effects through practical, in-camera techniques — forced perspective, set manipulation, lighting changes performed during takes — that produce dream-imagery without digital effects. The film's narrative (Joel undergoes a medical procedure to erase his memories of his ex-girlfriend Clementine, and during the erasure he decides he wants to keep the memories) is structured as a journey inward through the layers of Joel's memory, from recent to distant, from formed to fragmentary.

Gondry's in-camera techniques constitute a vocabulary of memory-dream:

*The dissolving set.* During the erasure sequence, the sets literally come apart around the actors: walls fall, objects disappear, lights go out, spaces collapse. These effects are achieved practically — stagehands remove set pieces during takes, lights are switched off in sequence, walls are pulled away on tracks. The actors perform in a space that is actively being dismantled, and their performances register the dismantlement: Carrey and Winslet react to the disappearing world with the bewildered acceptance of dreamers whose environment is changing without their consent.

*The forced-perspective memory.* Gondry uses forced perspective to place the adult Joel inside childhood memories as a tiny figure in an oversized world. The adult Joel sits at a child-sized table that is actually an oversized table, walks through a kitchen with enormous appliances, hides under a sink that is scaled to make him child-sized. The technique is entirely practical — oversized props, careful camera placement — and its materiality is crucial. The memory of being small is rendered by actually making the actor small in relation to his environment, not by digital shrinking. The body's relationship to space is physically altered, and the physicality of the alteration produces a kinesthetic dream-effect that digital scaling cannot achieve.

*The collapsing bookshelf.* In a key sequence, Joel runs through the Strand bookstore as the books on the shelves go blank — their spines losing their titles, their pages emptying — representing the erasure of his memories of buying books with Clementine. The effect was achieved by printing blank book spines and replacing the real ones during takes. The blankness spreads through the space as Joel moves through it, and the relationship between his movement and the erasure's advance creates the dream-logic of the chase: the void is pursuing you, and your movement through space is what triggers its advance, but you cannot stop moving because to stop is to be caught.

The Science of Sleep (Le Science des rêves, 2006) makes Gondry's dream-rendering method its explicit subject. The protagonist Stéphane builds his dreams out of craft materials — cardboard, cellophane, cotton, felt — and the film renders his dream sequences using these materials as practical effects. A cardboard city. A cellophane ocean. Cotton-wool clouds. The dreams are visibly handmade, and the visibility of the craft is the point: these are dreams made by a person who thinks in materials, whose unconscious is populated not by archetypes or symbols but by the physical properties of the things he works with. The craft materials are not metaphors for dream; they are the material of this particular dreamer's dream.

For PHANTASMATA, Gondry's contribution is the principle of the in-camera oneiric — the dream rendered through practical manipulation of the pro-filmic space rather than through post-production effects. In found-digital vocabulary: a video-log in which the physical space changes during a continuous shot — a poster on the wall that is different when the camera pans back, a piece of furniture that has moved, a window that now shows a different view — achieved through practical staging during the recording, so that the footage is technically unedited but the space is not consistent. This is the dream's logic encoded in the found-footage's premise: the camera recorded continuously, but the world in front of the camera was not continuous.

### B5. The Recursive Dreamers (2008–present)

#### Kaufman: Life as Rehearsal, Death as Dream

Charlie Kaufman's films (as writer and director) represent the most sustained investigation of recursive structures in contemporary cinema — narratives that contain representations of themselves, characters who discover they are characters, fictions that fold inward until the distinction between frame and content is inoperative.

Synecdoche, New York (2008), Kaufman's directorial debut, follows theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as he attempts to stage a play that is a full-scale replica of his life. He rents a warehouse in Manhattan and builds, inside it, a replica of the city. Within the replica, he casts actors to play himself and the people in his life. The actors begin to live in the replica, generating events that must themselves be replicated. Caden hires an actor to play himself directing the play, and that actor hires another actor to play himself playing Caden. The recursion is infinite: the play that represents life generates more life that must be represented, and the representation generates more representation.

The film's oneiric structure is not surrealist (the events are physically possible, if implausible) but recursive — the dream that contains itself, the representation that represents itself, the frame that frames itself. This is the formal structure of the lucid dream: the dream in which you know you are dreaming, and the knowledge of dreaming becomes the dream's content, and the content generates further knowledge of dreaming, and the recursion produces a vertigo that is not spatial but ontological — you cannot find the ground floor of reality because every floor you reach turns out to be built on another floor.

The film's title is itself recursive: "Synecdoche" (a figure of speech in which a part represents the whole) names the operation by which the warehouse-city represents the real city, the play-life represents the real life, the actor-Caden represents the real Caden. But the figure of speech has no stable direction: is the warehouse the synecdoche of the city, or is the city the synecdoche of the warehouse? Is the play the part that represents the whole of life, or is life the part that represents the whole of the play? The recursive structure refuses to stabilize into a hierarchy of representation, and this refusal is the dream's refusal: in a dream, you cannot determine which level is the "real" level because the dream provides no external frame from which to make the determination.

I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) renders the recursive dream as the consciousness of a dying man. The film presents what appears to be a straightforward narrative — a young woman (Jessie Buckley) accompanies her boyfriend Jake (Jesse Plemons) to visit his parents — but the details accumulate wrongness: the woman's name changes, her academic field changes, her clothing changes between cuts. The parents age and de-age within a single scene. The house is simultaneously Jake's childhood home and a place the woman has never visited. The film's "twist" — that the entire narrative is the dying dream of an elderly janitor who is Jake — is less a revelation than a confirmation: the wrongness was the signal, the dream's seams were visible from the start, and the recognition that you are watching a dying man's dream does not resolve the film but deepens it, because now every detail is simultaneously a fabrication (the dream's invention) and a truth (the dreamer's actual desire, actual regret, actual memory, reworked into the dream's fictional structure).

For PHANTASMATA, Kaufman's contribution is the recursive frame in found-digital format. A video-log in which the subject is recording themselves recording themselves — the phone filming a monitor that shows the phone's camera feed, with a slight delay that produces an infinite regress. A screen-capture of a social media profile that is following itself, or that has posted a screenshot of itself posting. A text-fragment that quotes itself, or that describes the act of writing itself, or that contains a character who is reading the text-fragment. These are recursive structures deployed in the formats of digital self-documentation, where the recursion is native: the selfie is already a recursive image (the self observing the self), the screen-capture is already a recursive document (the screen documenting the screen), and the social media profile is already a recursive performance (the self performing the self for an audience of selves).

#### Carax: The Performer Who Lives in Roles

Leos Carax's Holy Motors (2012) is a film about a man named Oscar (Denis Lavant) who travels through Paris in a white limousine, stopping at "appointments" where he assumes different identities: a motion-capture performer, a crazed sewer-dweller who kidnaps a fashion model, an assassin, a dying old man, a father picking up his daughter from a party, a man returning home to a family of chimpanzees. Between appointments, Oscar changes costume, applies makeup, and becomes — not "acts as," but becomes — a different person. There is no "real" Oscar behind the performances; Oscar is the performance function, the capacity for transformation, the emptiness that takes the shape of whatever role it enters.

The film's oneiric logic is the logic of the dream in which you are someone else — not the dream in which you observe someone else but the dream in which you are someone else, in which your identity has been replaced without your consent and without your surprise. Oscar does not choose his roles (they are assigned as "appointments"); he does not resist them (he performs them with total commitment); and he does not retain them (each role is abandoned completely when the next appointment arrives). This is the dream-self's relationship to identity: you are whoever the dream requires you to be, and the transition between identities is instantaneous, complete, and unquestioned.

The white limousine is the dream's vehicle — the space of transition between identities, the mobile dressing room where one self is removed and another applied. The film's Paris is a city seen only through the limousine's windows — a city of surfaces, of buildings sliding past, of spaces entered for the duration of a performance and then left. This is the dream's relationship to space: you are always arriving, always departing, never inhabiting. The city is not a place but a sequence of locations, each containing a role, each abandoned when the role is complete.

For PHANTASMATA, Carax's contribution is the principle of identity as appointment — the found-digital subject who assumes different identities across different platforms, different posts, different uploads, not as deception but as the native condition of digital selfhood. A series of video-logs in which the same physical person (recognizable by voice, by setting, by device artifacts) presents themselves as different people — different names, different histories, different affects — without acknowledging the inconsistency. The found-digital format naturalizes this: people have different usernames on different platforms, different personas for different audiences, different versions of themselves for different contexts. The horror is not the multiplicity (multiplicity is normal online) but the completeness of each identity — the total commitment that Oscar brings to each role, the absence of any "real" self behind the performances.

#### Weerasethakul: Past Lives, Animal Spirits, and the Sound Only One Person Hears

Apichatpong Weerasethakul's cinema operates at the boundary between waking and sleeping, between present and past, between human and animal, between the living and the dead — and it treats these boundaries not as dramatic thresholds to be crossed but as permeable membranes through which entities drift without announcement.

Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Loong Boonmee raleuk chat, 2010), winner of the Palme d'Or, presents a dying man (Thanapat Saisaymar) whose past lives visit him at his deathbed. His dead wife appears as a ghost — visible, conversational, present at the dinner table. His missing son appears as a "monkey ghost" — a creature with glowing red eyes who has mated with a monkey ghost and become one. These visitations are rendered without special-effects fanfare: the ghost wife simply appears at the table, and the conversation continues. The monkey ghost son walks out of the forest and sits down. The film treats the supernatural with the casualness of the quotidian, and this casualness is its oneiric signature. In a dream, the dead return without drama. They are simply there, as if they had never left, and the dreamer accepts their presence because the dream provides no framework for surprise. Weerasethakul reproduces this acceptance in the viewer by refusing to mark the supernatural — no musical sting, no reaction shot, no moment of recognition. The dead wife is at the table. Dinner continues.

The film contains a sequence that departs completely from the main narrative: a slide show of still photographs depicting a princess and a catfish. The princess sees her reflection in a pool and is disturbed by its beauty; the catfish speaks to her; she enters the water. The sequence is rendered in still images with narration — a return to Marker's photo-roman form — and its connection to the main narrative is associative rather than causal. The princess is one of Boonmee's past lives, or a story he tells, or a dream within his dying dream. The film does not specify. The connection exists at the level of resonance (water, transformation, the crossing of a boundary between human and non-human) rather than at the level of plot.

Memoria (2021) is the most radical oneiric film of the twenty-first century. Jessica (Tilda Swinton) is a Scottish woman in Colombia who hears a loud bang — a single, percussive sound — that no one else hears. She spends the film trying to locate the sound's source. She visits a recording studio to recreate it. She travels to a rural town. She meets a man (Elkin Díaz) who claims he can remember everything — not just his own life but the lives of all beings who have existed. He falls asleep in a field and does not wake up, and the film holds on his sleeping body for minutes of screen time while the ambient sound of the field — insects, wind, distant water — fills the soundtrack. The sound that Jessica hears may be a geological event, a memory of the landscape, a transmission from the deep time of the earth itself. The film does not resolve.

Memoria's oneiric quality is achieved through the radical elimination of conventional film grammar. There are no close-ups. There are no shot/reverse-shot dialogue sequences. There are no musical cues. There are no establishing shots. The camera is placed at a middle distance from its subjects and does not move. Each shot is held for the duration of the event it records — sometimes minutes — without cutting. The result is a perceptual state in the viewer that closely approximates the hypnagogic state (the boundary between waking and sleeping): you are aware of the world, you are processing sensory input, but your cognitive framework for organizing that input — the framework that tells you what is important, what to focus on, what to ignore — has been suspended. You watch the way a half-sleeping person watches: everything is equally present, nothing is hierarchized, and the world has the quality of significance without the structure of meaning.

For PHANTASMATA, Weerasethakul's contribution is the principle of the supernatural-as-ambient — the oneiric condition that is not marked as special but treated as the natural state of the world. A video-log in which impossible events occur without the recorder's visible reaction — a figure in the background that should not be there, a sound that has no source, a shadow that moves independently of any object. The found-digital format supports this: phone cameras record everything in their field without discrimination, and the recorder may not have noticed the anomaly that the viewer notices. The supernatural is not an event but a condition — something that is always present in the frame but not always attended to.

#### Nolan: Inception as Mainstream Dream-Film and Cautionary Example

Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) requires brief mention as the most commercially successful dream-film in cinema history (nearly $840 million worldwide), and as a cautionary example of what happens when dream logic is rationalized into a rule system.

Inception presents dream as a space that can be architecturally designed, entered through technology (the PASIV device), navigated according to consistent rules (dream time moves slower than waking time, death in the dream wakes you up, a "kick" — a falling sensation — can be used to trigger awakening), and defended against intrusion (the dreamer's projections attack foreign elements). The film introduces nested dream levels — a dream within a dream within a dream — with consistent temporal ratios between levels.

The film's formal achievement is the visualization of dream architecture as literal architecture: Ariadne (Elliot Page) folds a Parisian street onto itself like a hinge, creates infinite staircases (Penrose steps), designs interior spaces that violate external geometry. These sequences are the film's oneiric peaks — the moments when the rule system yields to visual impossibility.

But Inception's dream logic is precisely the problem from PHANTASMATA's perspective. Real dreams are weirder than Inception allows. Real dreams do not have consistent rules, temporal ratios, or hierarchical levels. Real dreams do not obey spatial geometry even when they violate it. Real dreams do not have extraction teams, security projections, or totems. Inception's dreams are too rational, too architectural, too designed. They are dreams dreamed by an engineer, not by an unconscious. The film demonstrates that the mainstream audience wants dream to be comprehensible — wants rules, wants levels, wants totems — and this desire is exactly what PHANTASMATA must resist. The dream that can be fully understood is not a dream; it is a puzzle. PHANTASMATA's dream must resist comprehension, must remain partially opaque, must produce the specific frustration of the dreamer who knows that the dream means something but cannot determine what.

For PHANTASMATA, Inception is a negative example: the demonstration of how not to render dream. The film's positive contribution is limited to the concept of the totem — the object that tells you whether you are dreaming or awake. This concept is translatable: a recurring detail in PHANTASMATA's outputs that the viewer might use to determine whether a given fragment is "real" or "dream" within the container's universe. The trick is that the totem must be unreliable — it must sometimes indicate dream when the content is "real" and sometimes indicate reality when the content is dream. A reliable totem is an Inception-style rationalization; an unreliable totem is a Lynchian epistemological weapon.

### B6. Japanese Oneiric Traditions

#### Kurosawa: Eight Dreams as Anthology of Oneiric Modes

Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (Yume, 1990) is an anthology film of eight dream vignettes, each based on a recurring dream of Kurosawa's own. The film is a catalogue of oneiric modes — eight different formal strategies for rendering dream — and its value for PHANTASMATA is taxonomic rather than singular: it demonstrates the range of registers available within the dream mode.

"Sunshine Through the Rain" presents the childhood prohibition dream: a boy is told not to go out because foxes hold their wedding procession in the rain, and to witness the procession is forbidden. The boy goes out, watches the procession (rendered as a slow, ceremonial march through a sunlit forest with rain falling), and returns home to find that the foxes have left a knife for him — the punishment for witnessing the forbidden. The dream is rendered through the conjunction of contradictory natural phenomena (sunshine and rain simultaneously) and the ceremonial pace of the procession (too slow for narrative, too rhythmic for documentary).

"The Peach Orchard" presents the mourning dream: a boy encounters the spirits of peach trees that have been cut down, who perform a traditional dance and then vanish, leaving a single young sapling. The dream is rendered through the multiplication of figures (the spirits appear in dozens, arranged in ceremonial formations on a hillside) and through the dance itself — a form of movement that is human but patterned, individual but collective, performed but ritualized.

"Crows" is the most famous vignette: a man enters a series of van Gogh paintings, walks through the wheat fields of The Harvest and Starry Night, and meets van Gogh himself (played by Martin Scorsese) painting furiously in a field. The dream of entering a painting — of crossing the frame that separates the viewer from the image — is the foundational dream of visual art, and Kurosawa renders it through ILM-produced visual effects that composite live-action figures into painterly landscapes. The vignette's formal principle is the dissolution of the frame: the boundary between the museum (where the dreamer views the paintings) and the painting's interior (where the dreamer walks) is crossed without transition.

"Mount Fuji in Red" presents the apocalyptic dream: nuclear power plants have exploded, Mount Fuji is engulfed in flames, and radioactive fallout descends in colored plumes (red, yellow, blue — each color representing a different isotope, a different form of death). The dream is rendered through the identification of color with threat — the beautiful colors of the fallout are the beautiful colors of death — and through the claustrophobic geography (the characters are trapped on a coastal cliff with the ocean behind them and the fallout advancing).

For PHANTASMATA, Kurosawa's Dreams demonstrates that the dream-film is inherently anthological — that dream does not sustain extended narrative but fragments into discrete episodes, each with its own logic, its own visual vocabulary, its own emotional register. This maps onto PHANTASMATA's container model: the registry is not a single sustained dream but a collection of dream-fragments (video-logs, screen-captures, audio-logs, text-fragments, mock-posts), each complete in itself, each operating according to its own oneiric logic, and connected to the others not by plot but by recurring images, recurring affects, recurring formal principles.

#### Obayashi: Formal Anarchy as Dream Logic

Nobuhiko Obayashi's House (Hausu, 1977) is the most formally anarchic dream-film ever made — a film that achieves dream logic not through any single technique but through the simultaneous deployment of every technique: animation overlaid on live action, matte paintings that are visibly painted, rear projection with deliberately mismatched scales, color gels that change within shots, editing that violates every continuity principle, a soundtrack that combines jazz piano, prog rock, and children's songs in impossible sequences.

The narrative — seven schoolgirls visit a country house that turns out to be haunted by the aunt's ghost, which devours them one by one through the house's architecture (a piano eats the pianist's fingers, a futon smothers, a clock bleeds, a chandelier attacks) — is structured as a succession of set-pieces, each employing a different combination of formal excesses. The film has no consistent visual register; each scene reinvents the film's visual vocabulary from scratch. The result is a viewing experience that replicates the dream's formal inconstancy — the way a dream can shift from realistic to cartoonish to abstract to photographic within a single sequence, without the dreamer registering the shift as a discontinuity.

Obayashi's formal anarchy was deliberate. He asked his pre-teen daughter Chigumi to generate the film's horror scenarios on the principle that children's fears have the uncensored logic of dream — they do not conform to genre convention or narrative plausibility. A piano that eats fingers is not a "good" horror concept by genre standards; it is a child's nightmare, and its power comes from the fact that it does not submit to the rationality of adult horror. It is irrational in the way dreams are irrational — not randomly but with the perfect logic of a system whose rules are emotional rather than physical.

For PHANTASMATA, Hausu's contribution is the principle of formal inconsistency as oneiric effect. A series of PHANTASMATA outputs that deliberately vary in visual quality, aspect ratio, color profile, and audio quality — not because they are "from different sources" (the conventional found-footage explanation) but because the container's dream does not maintain formal consistency. One video-log is crisp 4K; the next is degraded 240p. One audio-log is clean studio recording; the next is barely audible through distortion. The inconsistency is not explained; it is the dream's prerogative.

#### Oshii: The Dream-Film as Pure Image

Mamoru Oshii's Angel's Egg (Tenshi no Tamago, 1985) is the dream-film reduced to its minimum: a feature-length film with almost no dialogue, no conventional narrative, and no explanatory frame. A girl carries a large egg through a ruined city populated by fishermen who harpoon shadows. A soldier accompanies her. A fossilized tree of enormous size dominates the landscape. The city is flooded with dark water. Everything happens at the pace of ritual — slowly, deliberately, with the ceremonial quality of gestures that are significant but whose significance is not disclosed.

The film is post-apocalyptic but the apocalypse is not identified. The characters are named but not characterized. The egg is central but its contents are never revealed. The fishermen's shadow-harpooning is the film's recurring set-piece but its purpose is never explained. Angel's Egg operates in the register of the dream that you remember after waking — the dream whose images are vivid and precise but whose narrative is absent. You remember the egg, the ruined city, the fishermen, the shadows. You do not remember why. The film preserves the dream's ratio of image to narrative: maximum image, minimum narrative. The surplus of image over narrative is what produces the oneiric effect — the sense that the images mean more than the narrative can contain.

#### The Connection to Kon

Satoshi Kon — already extensively analyzed in the anchor director deep research report — extends the Japanese oneiric tradition into animation with the addition of the media-layer that is his signature. Where Kurosawa's dreams are purely interior (the dreamer's own psychological landscape), where Obayashi's are anarchically playful (the child's nightmare rendered with pop-art excess), and where Oshii's are purely imagistic (the dream stripped of narrative), Kon's dreams are mediated — they pass through television screens, computer monitors, film projectors, advertising billboards. Kon's contribution to the Japanese oneiric tradition is the recognition that in a media-saturated society, dream itself is mediated: you do not dream your own images but images that have been transmitted to you, and the dream's material is not your unconscious but the media environment's collective unconscious.

Perfect Blue's Mima does not dream in the conventional sense; she experiences media-mediated dissociation. Millennium Actress's Chiyoko does not remember; she re-performs the films she starred in, and her memories are indistinguishable from her performances. Paprika's dream-therapy technology does not access the individual unconscious; it accesses a shared dream-space that is structured like the internet — collaborative, permeable, populated by images from every source. These are not dreams about media; they are dreams that are media — dreams whose formal structure is identical to the structure of the media environment in which the dreamer lives.

For PHANTASMATA, Kon's mediated dream is the native register. The container's outputs are not dreams captured on digital media; they are dreams that are digital media — dreams whose form is the form of the video-log, the screen-capture, the audio-log, the mock-post. The dream does not exist independently of its mediation. The mediation is the dream. This is the $KON_SPIRAL at maximum: the point at which the distinction between the dream and its recording has become inoperative.

## C) Techniques Inventory

The following techniques are extracted from the dream cinema tradition for direct application in PHANTASMATA creative production. Each technique is identified by a descriptive name, defined in its formal operation, analyzed for its horror function (how dream becomes specifically dread), illustrated with examples, and tagged with the PHANTASMATA output format(s) for which it has strongest affinity.

---

**Technique 01: The Associative Cut**

**Definition:** An edit that connects two shots not through spatial, temporal, or causal continuity but through visual, sonic, or emotional resonance. The association may be formal (similar shapes, similar colors, similar movements), thematic (shared emotional charge), or indexical (a shared object that appears in both contexts). The cut bypasses narrative logic and operates at the level of dream-logic: this follows that because they feel related, not because one causes the other.

**Horror function:** The associative cut produces epistemological dislocation — the viewer recognizes the connection between the two shots but cannot articulate why the connection matters. The felt significance without available interpretation reproduces the dream's specific anxiety: the sense that the world is communicating something important in a language you almost understand. In horror, this becomes the dread of pattern recognition without pattern comprehension — you see the connection between the two images but you cannot determine whether the connection is meaningful or coincidental, threatening or benign.

**Examples:** Buñuel's moon/eye association in Un Chien Andalou; Tarkovsky's barn-fire-to-newsreel cut in Mirror; Resnais' garden-to-bedroom transitions in Marienbad; Weerasethakul's past-life-to-present transitions in Uncle Boonmee; Marker's Japan-to-Guinea-Bissau transitions in Sans Soleil.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (cuts between footage that shares visual elements but not narrative context); screen-capture (screenshots arranged by visual rhyme rather than chronology); text-fragment (paragraphs that follow each other through tonal resonance rather than argument).

---

**Technique 02: The Recurring Object**

**Definition:** An object that appears across multiple scenes, contexts, or temporal registers without narrative justification for its recurrence. The object accumulates meaning through repetition — each appearance adds a new context to the object's significance without resolving its meaning into a single interpretation. The object is overdetermined: it means too much, and the surplus of meaning is what gives it its oneiric charge.

**Horror function:** The recurring object produces the dread of significance — the sense that this object matters, that its recurrence is not coincidental, that it is trying to communicate something. In horror, the recurring object is the talisman, the fetish, the cursed thing — the object that appears where it should not be, that persists across contexts that should not share it, that accumulates the negative charge of every context in which it has appeared. The viewer cannot ignore it (it keeps appearing) and cannot interpret it (its meaning is overdetermined), and this combination of compulsory attention and interpretive failure is the specific dread of the dream-object.

**Examples:** Deren's key/knife in Meshes of the Afternoon; the glass of water in Stalker; the blue box in Mulholland Drive; the spinning top in Inception; the egg in Angel's Egg; the candle in Nostalghia.

**Output format affinity:** All formats. A detail that recurs across video-logs (a specific object visible in the background), screen-captures (a specific icon or notification), audio-logs (a specific ambient sound), text-fragments (a specific word or phrase), and mock-posts (a specific emoji or hashtag).

---

**Technique 03: Duration as Dream**

**Definition:** The sustained observation of an ordinary event or object for a period that exceeds the viewer's narrative expectations, such that the act of observation itself becomes the content. Duration transforms perception: an object watched for ten seconds is a detail; the same object watched for three minutes is a meditation; watched for nine minutes (the candle-carrying in Nostalghia), it is a state of consciousness.

**Horror function:** Duration produces anxiety through the violation of temporal expectations. The viewer expects events to happen at narrative pace — setup, development, resolution — and when the image persists beyond narrative necessity, the viewer begins to suspect that something else is happening, that the duration is purposeful, that the image is withholding a revelation that will arrive only if you keep watching. In horror, duration becomes the temporal equivalent of the corridor that extends beyond its expected length: you keep walking (watching) but the end does not arrive, and the failure of the expected resolution becomes the horror. The dread is specifically temporal: the dread of time that will not pass, of an image that will not yield.

**Examples:** Tarkovsky's candle-crossing in Nostalghia (9 minutes); the long tracking shots through the Zone in Stalker; Weerasethakul's sleeping man in Memoria (several minutes of motionless observation); the final shot of Kubrick's The Shining (the slow zoom into the photograph); Chantal Akerman's extended domestic routines in Jeanne Dielman.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage that holds a single shot far longer than expected — a room, a screen, a view from a window — without cut or movement); audio-log (sustained ambient recording without speech or event — the sound of an empty room for five minutes).

---

**Technique 04: The Liquid Mirror**

**Definition:** A reflective surface that yields — that becomes permeable, that admits passage. The mirror (or window, or screen, or body of water) functions as a threshold between reality-registers: this side is waking, that side is dream; this side is life, that side is death; this side is the present, that side is the past. The crossing is rendered materially — through the physical properties of the reflecting surface (its liquidity, its trembling, its response to touch).

**Horror function:** The liquid mirror produces the dread of the permeable boundary — the discovery that the surface separating you from the other side is not solid. In horror, the mirror that yields is the mirror that can be entered from either side: if you can pass through the mirror into the dream, then the dream can pass through the mirror into your reality. The liquid mirror is a two-way threshold, and the horror is in the realization that the traffic may not be under your control.

**Examples:** Cocteau's mercury-surface mirrors in Orphée and Blood of a Poet; the water-surface reflections in Tarkovsky's Stalker and Mirror; the dark monitor that shows a different reflection in Lynch's work; the pool that shows the princess's transformed face in Uncle Boonmee.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which a reflective surface — a phone screen, a window at night, a bathroom mirror — shows something that does not match the space being recorded); screen-capture (a screenshot in which a dark application window reflects content from the room rather than from the application).

---

**Technique 05: The Spatial Impossibility**

**Definition:** A space that violates Euclidean geometry without announcement — a corridor that is longer inside than outside, a room that connects to a room that should not be adjacent, a building whose interior layout does not match its exterior dimensions. The impossibility is not marked as special; the characters move through the impossible space with the dreamer's acceptance of spatial violations.

**Examples:** Deren's discontinuous walking surfaces in Meshes of the Afternoon; the impossible geometry of Marienbad's gardens; the Zone's shifting geography in Stalker; the folding city in Inception; the warehouse that contains a city in Synecdoche, New York; the impossible architecture of the Beast's castle in Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast.

**Horror function:** Spatial impossibility produces the dread of the untrustworthy environment — the discovery that the space you are in does not obey the rules you use to navigate it. In horror, impossible space is threatening because it prevents escape: if the corridor is longer than it should be, you cannot reach the exit; if the rooms connect in impossible ways, you cannot map the building; if the geography shifts, you cannot retrace your steps. The space itself has become hostile, and the hostility is structural rather than intentional — the space does not want to trap you; it simply does not work the way spaces are supposed to work.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which spatial continuity is violated — a doorway that leads to a room that was previously reached through a different doorway; a window that shows a different view than the same window showed earlier); screen-capture (a map application showing a route that doubles back on itself impossibly; a floor plan that does not close).

---

**Technique 06: The Tactile Uncanny**

**Definition:** The rendering of surfaces and textures with such intimate closeness that the viewer experiences a haptic response — the sensation of being touched through the eyes. Objects are filmed at distances and magnifications that make their physical properties (grain, moisture, temperature, weight) perceptually available. The uncanny emerges when the closeness reveals properties that should not be present: warmth in a stone, moisture in dry wood, movement in a still object.

**Horror function:** The tactile uncanny produces the dread of unwanted proximity — the sensation that the object is too close, that it is pressing against you, that the distance necessary for safe observation has been violated. In horror, the haptic image makes the viewer feel that the horror is not in front of them but on them — touching their skin, entering their space, contaminating them through contact rather than through vision.

**Examples:** Švankmajer's close-ups of food, clay, and organic matter in Alice and Conspirators of Pleasure; the Quays' textured miniature surfaces in Street of Crocodiles; the extreme close-ups of water, moss, and decay in Tarkovsky's Zone; the tactile quality of Gondry's cardboard and cellophane dream-materials.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (extreme close-up footage shot on a phone camera — the grain of a surface, the texture of skin, the condensation on glass — held long enough to become haptic); audio-log (sounds recorded at intimate proximity — breath, swallowing, the rustle of fabric against a microphone — that produce the sensation of physical closeness).

**Technique 07: The Memory Loop**

**Definition:** A sequence that repeats with variation — the same events, the same spatial trajectory, the same dialogue, but with accumulated changes that mark each iteration as different from the last. The loop does not return to its starting point; it spirals, advancing through variation while maintaining the structural form of repetition.

**Horror function:** The memory loop produces the dread of the inescapable — the recognition that you have been here before and will be here again, that the variations are not corrections but degradations, that each iteration moves further from the original without achieving resolution. In horror, the loop is the trap: the dream that will not end, the memory that will not stop replaying, the experience that has been compressed into a cycle from which no exit is available.

**Examples:** Deren's recursive iterations in Meshes of the Afternoon; the repeating dinner attempts in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie; the memory-erasure loop in Eternal Sunshine; the recursive warehouse in Synecdoche, New York; Kaufman's dying-mind loop in I'm Thinking of Ending Things.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage that appears to restart — same framing, same location, but details have changed); text-fragment (a narrative that repeats its own paragraphs with modifications); screen-capture (a series of screenshots that show the same interface with progressive alterations).

---

**Technique 08: The Sepia/Color Reality Shift**

**Definition:** A change in the color register of the image — from desaturated to saturated, from monochrome to color, from one color palette to another — that signals a change in reality-register. The shift may be gradual (a slow saturation increase) or instantaneous (a cut between different color worlds). The color change does not correspond to a lighting change within the diegesis; it corresponds to a perceptual or ontological change in the dreamer's relationship to the world.

**Horror function:** The reality shift produces the dread of the ungoverned transition — the discovery that you have moved from one reality-register to another without choosing to, without being warned, and without being able to return. In horror, the color shift signals contamination: the dream's palette has invaded the waking world's palette, or the waking world's palette has been revealed as already oneiric. The boundary between registers has been crossed, and the crossing was not voluntary.

**Examples:** The sepia-to-color transition in Stalker; the black-and-white-to-color transition in The Wizard of Oz; the desaturation shifts in Eyes Wide Shut; the progressive color-loss in Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things; the bold gel-color intrusions in Argento's Suspiria.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage whose color profile shifts during a continuous take — auto-white-balance anomalies, sudden saturation changes, the shift from normal to night-mode); screen-capture (screenshots that show the same interface in different color modes — dark mode, high contrast, inverted colors — as if the device's display settings are changing without user input).

---

**Technique 09: The Automatism Principle**

**Definition:** The generation of content through the suppression of rational control — allowing associative, unconscious, or aleatory processes to determine what appears. In surrealist practice, this meant automatic writing, exquisite corpse, and dream transcription. In found-digital practice, it means allowing the device's autonomous processes (autocorrect, predictive text, algorithmic recommendation, glitch) to generate content that the "author" did not intend.

**Horror function:** Automatism produces the dread of the unintended — the content that arrives without being summoned, that appears in the output without having been input, that suggests an agency operating through the medium that is not the user's agency. In horror, the automatism principle is the message you did not write, the image you did not capture, the sound you did not record — the evidence that the device is producing content on its own, or that something is producing content through the device.

**Examples:** Buñuel and Dalí's working method for Un Chien Andalou (accepting only images that resist rational explanation); Deren's intuitive editing process; the Quays' improvised animation sequences; predictive text horror (a phone's autocomplete generating threatening sentences); algorithmic recommendation horror (a feed surfacing content that seems personally targeted in impossible ways).

**Output format affinity:** text-fragment (text that appears to have been generated by autocomplete or predictive text — coherent syntax, incoherent meaning, occasional flashes of eerie accuracy); mock-post (a social media post whose content does not match the poster's apparent intent, as if the post wrote itself); screen-capture (a screenshot showing an algorithm-generated recommendation that is impossibly relevant to the viewer's private circumstances).

---

**Technique 10: The Levitation Shot**

**Definition:** A figure or object that floats — that is suspended in space without visible support, defying gravity without comment. The levitation is not presented as a miracle or a power; it is presented as a condition, a state, the way things are in this particular zone of reality. The figure does not fly (fly implies intention and trajectory); it floats (float implies passivity and suspension).

**Horror function:** Levitation produces the dread of the ungoverned body — the body that is no longer subject to the fundamental physical law (gravity) that anchors all embodied experience. In horror, levitation signals possession or dissolution: the body has been claimed by a force that is not gravity, or the body has lost its relationship to the physical world entirely. The floating body is the body that is no longer in the world but above it, beyond it, removed from it — the body that has entered a state where the rules of embodiment no longer apply.

**Examples:** The levitation sequence in Tarkovsky's Mirror (the mother floating above the bed); the floating bodies in Tarkovsky's Nostalghia; the bed-levitation in The Exorcist; the zero-gravity hotel corridor in Inception; the floating figures in Weerasethakul's work.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which an object or element appears to be in the wrong gravitational relationship to the environment — a curtain that drifts upward, water that falls sideways, hair that stands without wind); screen-capture (an image in which shadow-lines indicate a light source that would require the object to be floating).

---

**Technique 11: Indoor Rain**

**Definition:** Precipitation — rain, snow, dripping water — occurring inside an enclosed space where it has no physical source. The indoor rain is not the result of a leak or a broken pipe; it has no diegetic cause. It is a weather event that has penetrated the boundary between exterior and interior, between the world's climate and the room's shelter.

**Horror function:** Indoor rain produces the dread of the compromised shelter — the discovery that the space that should protect you from the environment has been penetrated by the environment. The inside has become the outside. The room is no longer a room; it is an extension of the weather. In horror, indoor rain signals the dissolution of the boundary between the controlled (interior, domestic, safe) and the uncontrolled (exterior, natural, dangerous). The rain does not threaten; it indicates that the space itself has lost its capacity to separate you from what is outside.

**Examples:** The rain inside the house in Tarkovsky's Stalker; the indoor rain in Mirror and Nostalghia; the dripping walls in Švankmajer's Alice; the water that seeps through walls in various Lynch interiors; the flooded rooms in Weerasethakul's Uncle Boonmee.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage of a domestic interior in which water appears — dripping from a ceiling with no visible source, condensation on walls in patterns that suggest rain, a puddle forming on a dry floor); audio-log (the sound of rain recorded indoors, with the acoustics indicating an enclosed space — no wind, no traffic, only the rain, impossibly present inside).

---

**Technique 12: The Frozen Gesture**

**Definition:** A human figure that arrests mid-action — a hand reaching, a mouth opening, a step in progress — and holds the position while time continues around them. The freeze is not a pause (which implies voluntary control) but an interruption (which implies an external force). The figure is caught, held, suspended in the act.

**Horror function:** The frozen gesture produces the dread of temporal seizure — the body trapped in a moment, unable to complete the action, unable to withdraw. In horror, the frozen figure is the victim of time itself: time has stopped for this body while continuing for the world, and the figure is stranded in an instant that will not pass. The gesture, never completed, becomes permanent — the reaching hand will always reach, the opening mouth will always open — and this permanence is a form of imprisonment.

**Examples:** The frozen tableaux in Last Year at Marienbad; the stop-motion suspension in Švankmajer's work; the time-freeze in Cocteau's Blood of a Poet; the frozen gestures of sleeping figures in Weerasethakul; the still photographs in La Jetée (the entire film is frozen gesture except for one moment).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which a figure freezes while background elements continue — traffic moves, wind blows, but the person is still); screen-capture (a screenshot of a video call in which one participant has frozen due to connection issues, while the other continues to speak — the "buffering person" as accidental frozen gesture).

---

**Technique 13: The Decayed Footage**

**Definition:** Visual or sonic material that has been degraded — through physical damage to the recording medium, through digital compression and re-compression, through format conversion, or through the passage of time — such that the degradation itself becomes the content's primary formal property. The decay is not an obstacle to reading the content; it is the content's expressive register.

**Horror function:** The decayed footage produces the dread of the irrecoverable — the information that once existed and has been partially destroyed. The gaps in the degraded image or sound are productive absences: the viewer's imagination populates them with content that is, by definition, worse than any visible content could be. What has been lost is always more frightening than what remains, because the lost content is unconstrained by the limits of what can actually be shown or heard.

**Examples:** Maddin's deliberately degraded film stock in Brand Upon the Brain! and The Forbidden Room; the VHS artifacts in analog horror; the generation-loss aesthetics of found-footage horror; the degraded audio in Caul's recordings in The Conversation; the deteriorating image quality in Ringu's cursed tape.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage with progressive digital degradation — increasing compression artifacts, resolution loss, color-space collapse); audio-log (recordings with dropout, clipping, sample-rate reduction, the specific artifacts of over-compressed audio); text-fragment (text with encoding errors, format-conversion artifacts, garbled characters — the textual equivalent of visual noise).

---

**Technique 14: The Dream-Within-Dream**

**Definition:** A nested narrative structure in which the dreamer wakes from a dream into another dream, without the film (or the dreamer) confirming which level is the "outermost" reality. The structure may have two levels, three levels, or (in extreme cases) an indeterminate number. The key property is the absence of a confirmed ground floor: no level is reliably identified as "waking."

**Horror function:** The dream-within-dream produces the dread of infinite regression — the recognition that every apparent awakening may be another layer, that the "real" may never be reached, that the ground floor does not exist. In horror, the nested dream is the ultimate trap: you cannot escape by waking because waking is another dream. The structure attacks the viewer's confidence in the concept of awakening itself — the idea that there exists a stable, non-dream reality to which the dreamer can return.

**Examples:** The dreams-within-dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie; the nested narrative levels in Inception; the ambiguous reality-layers in Mulholland Drive; the recursive warehouse in Synecdoche, New York; the narrative levels in The Forbidden Room.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (a video-log that shows the subject watching a video-log that shows the subject watching a video-log — each level slightly different); screen-capture (a screenshot of a screen displaying a screenshot of a screen); text-fragment (a narrative within a narrative within a narrative, each frame slightly contaminated by the level above or below).

---

**Technique 15: The Wind That Has No Source**

**Definition:** A movement of air — disturbing curtains, stirring hair, rustling papers, bending grass — that has no visible or diegetic origin. No window is open. No fan is running. No door has been passed through. The wind simply arrives, announcing a change in reality-register without identifying its cause.

**Horror function:** The sourceless wind produces the dread of the invisible agent — the force that acts on the visible world without being visible itself. In horror, wind without source is the signature of presence without body: something is here, exerting physical force, moving physical objects, but has no material form. The wind is the ghost's most minimal manifestation — less than a shadow, less than a sound, but physically real, physically felt, physically effective.

**Examples:** The indoor wind in Tarkovsky's Mirror and Stalker; the curtains billowing without wind in Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast; the sourceless breeze in Lynch's interiors; the wind that moves through Weerasethakul's landscapes without visible cause.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which objects move as if disturbed by air current — papers shifting, a door swinging slightly, a curtain lifting — in a space that is visibly enclosed); audio-log (the sound of wind in a recording made indoors, with no environmental explanation).

---

**Technique 16: The Identity Substitution**

**Definition:** A character who is played by two different actors, or an actor who plays two different characters, without the film acknowledging or explaining the substitution. The narrative treats the substituted identity as continuous — the character has the same name, the same relationships, the same position — while the body has changed.

**Horror function:** The identity substitution produces the dread of the replaceable self — the discovery that your identity is not anchored in your body, that someone else can occupy your position without the world noticing or objecting. In horror, the substitution is the body-snatcher scenario: the person you know has been replaced by another person, and no one else can see the difference. The dreamer's acceptance of the substitution (in Buñuel's Obscure Object, the protagonist does not appear to notice that Conchita's body keeps changing) reproduces the dream's most unsettling property: the inability to be surprised by the impossible.

**Examples:** The two actresses playing Conchita in That Obscure Object of Desire; Terekhova playing both mother and wife in Mirror; the Fred/Pete transformation in Lost Highway; the Betty/Diane split in Mulholland Drive; Oscar's role-changes in Holy Motors.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which the subject subtly changes between uploads — not a different person but not quite the same person, the way a dream-character can be "your mother" while having a stranger's face); mock-post (a social media profile whose selfies show subtle inconsistencies in physical features between posts).

---

**Technique 17: The Supernatural as Ambient**

**Definition:** Supernatural or impossible events that occur without narrative emphasis — no dramatic music, no reaction shots, no moment of recognition. The impossible is treated as ambient, as the background condition of the world rather than as an exceptional event requiring response. Characters do not react to the impossible because, within their reality-register, it is not impossible; it is merely present.

**Horror function:** The ambient supernatural produces the dread of the normalized impossible — the recognition that the characters inhabit a world in which the supernatural is routine, and that the viewer's shock at the impossible events is evidence not of the events' impossibility but of the viewer's insufficient understanding of the world. The viewer is the outsider — the one who does not belong, who does not understand the rules, who is disturbed by conditions that the inhabitants find unremarkable. This reversal of the horror dynamic (the viewer, not the character, is the vulnerable one) produces a distinctive and persistent unease.

**Examples:** The ghost wife at the dinner table in Uncle Boonmee; the monkey ghosts in the forest in Uncle Boonmee; the architectural impossibilities in Cocteau's Beast's castle (arms in walls, eyes in architecture), accepted without comment; the indoor rain in Tarkovsky's films, unremarked upon by characters; the sleeping man in Memoria, whom Jessica observes without visible alarm.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which something impossible is visible in the background — a figure that should not be there, a shadow without a source, an object in an impossible position — but the recorder does not react, does not comment, may not have noticed); audio-log (ambient sound that includes an element that should not be present — a voice in an empty room, a mechanical sound in a natural environment — without the recorder's acknowledgment).

---

**Technique 18: The Reverse-Motion Signature**

**Definition:** Footage that plays in reverse — partially or wholly — within otherwise forward-moving material. The reversal may affect a single element (a gesture that rewinds), a single figure (a person who walks backward with the smooth gait of reversed footage rather than the awkward gait of someone actually walking backward), or the entire frame.

**Horror function:** Reverse motion produces the dread of temporal violation — the visible evidence that time's arrow has been reversed, that the fundamental irreversibility of experience has been suspended. In horror, reversed footage is the signature of the Zone, the otherworld, the space where the laws of physics do not apply. The uncanny of reverse motion is specific: it looks almost right but not quite, the way a dream-movement looks almost like real movement but with a quality of wrongness that cannot be precisely identified.

**Examples:** Cocteau's reversed footage in Orphée (characters moving backward through the Zone); the reversed speech in Twin Peaks; the reversed movements in Lynch's Black Lodge sequences; the reversed choreography in Gondry's music videos; the subtle reversal effects in Weerasethakul's work.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (a brief segment of reversed footage within otherwise forward-playing material — a hand that retracts to a surface it was lifting from, a step that unwalks, liquid that flows upward); audio-log (a segment of reversed speech embedded in forward speech — the digital equivalent of backmasking).

---

**Technique 19: The Dream-Walk**

**Definition:** A sustained sequence of ambulatory movement through a space — a figure walking through corridors, streets, rooms, landscapes — at a pace and with a quality of attention that transforms the walk from transportation into exploration, from narrative event into perceptual state. The dream-walk has no destination; it is the walking itself that constitutes the experience.

**Horror function:** The dream-walk produces the dread of the destination that does not arrive — the corridor that extends, the street that continues, the landscape that does not resolve into a place. In horror, the dream-walk is the journey without end, the movement that does not produce progress, the walking that accumulates observation without approaching resolution. The walker sees everything and arrives nowhere. The world is infinitely detailed and infinitely empty.

**Examples:** Bill Harford's nocturnal wandering in Eyes Wide Shut; the Stalker's guided walks through the Zone; the pedestrian sequences in Holy Motors; the walking-through-memories in Eternal Sunshine; the sleeping walks in Weerasethakul's films.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (POV footage of walking through a space — a building, a neighborhood, a digital environment — at night or in low light, without destination, the camera recording everything with equal attention); screen-capture (a recording of scrolling through a feed, a map, a website — the digital dream-walk, the aimless navigation of information space).

---

**Technique 20: The Sound That Has No Source**

**Definition:** An auditory event that cannot be attributed to any visible or diegetically plausible source — a bang, a hum, a voice, a tone — that is heard by the characters and/or the audience without physical explanation. The sound may be naturalistic (a door slamming in a building with no doors) or abstract (a low-frequency tone that has no natural analog).

**Horror function:** The sourceless sound produces the dread of the invisible — the auditory evidence of a presence or event that cannot be verified visually. Sound without source is the most direct rendering of the dream's auditory experience: in dreams, sounds arrive without the spatial logic that anchors waking audition (direction, distance, occlusion). A voice speaks from no direction. A sound occurs at no distance. The sourceless sound in cinema reproduces this spatial disorientation and the anxiety it produces.

**Examples:** The "bang" in Memoria (the entire film's engine); the industrial drones in Lynch's soundscapes; the unlocatable sounds in Stalker's Zone; the breathing that comes from the walls in Švankmajer's Alice; the organ music in Marienbad; the backward speech in Twin Peaks.

**Output format affinity:** audio-log (a recording that captures a sound the recorder cannot identify or locate — the found-audio equivalent of the ghost photograph); video-log (footage in which the recorder reacts to a sound the viewer also hears but cannot attribute to any visible source).

---

**Technique 21: The Photograph of the Future**

**Definition:** An image — a photograph, a screenshot, a recording — that depicts events or conditions that have not yet occurred, discovered before the depicted events take place. The proleptic image collapses temporal sequence: the future has already been documented, the event has already been recorded, the outcome already exists as an image before it exists as an experience.

**Horror function:** The proleptic image produces the dread of predetermination — the discovery that the future is not open but already closed, already documented, already an image in an archive. In horror, the photograph of the future is the inescapable fate: you have seen what will happen, and the image's existence implies that it cannot be prevented. The future has already been photographed because it has already happened; you simply have not caught up to it yet.

**Examples:** The photograph of the future in Uncle Boonmee; La Jetée's temporal paradox (the protagonist witnesses his own death in the "past"); the polaroid sequence in Memento; the prophetic dreams in Kurosawa's Dreams; the preview-of-death in Final Destination (a mainstream horror application of the proleptic image).

**Output format affinity:** screen-capture (a screenshot with a date stamp in the future; a "memory" notification showing an image from a date that has not occurred); mock-post (a social media post with a future timestamp; a scheduled post that describes events the poster should not yet know about).

---

**Technique 22: The Impossible Reflection**

**Definition:** A reflective surface — mirror, window, water, screen — that does not reflect the scene in front of it, or that reflects it with alterations (a different arrangement of objects, a different person, a different time of day). The reflection is autonomous — it operates according to its own reality rather than serving as a faithful copy of the reflected world.

**Horror function:** The impossible reflection produces the dread of the autonomous double — the discovery that your mirror image has its own agenda, its own timeline, its own reality. In horror, the impossible reflection is the evidence that the other side of the mirror is not a copy of this side but a separate world that merely resembles this one, and that the resemblance is breaking down.

**Examples:** The autonomous reflections in Cocteau's Orphic trilogy; the wrong reflections in Lynch's work; the mirror that shows a different face in various horror films; the reflections in water that show a different landscape in Tarkovsky; the self that moves independently in Meshes of the Afternoon.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage in which a reflective surface — a phone screen, a dark window, a bathroom mirror — shows content that does not match the recorded environment); screen-capture (a screenshot showing a video call where the user's own camera feed does not match their actual appearance or surroundings).

---

**Technique 23: The Shared Dream**

**Definition:** A dream state experienced simultaneously by multiple subjects, such that the dream's content is not private (one person's unconscious) but collective (a shared psychic space). The shared dream raises the question of authorship: who is dreaming this? If the dream is shared, it belongs to no one, and its contents are not expressions of individual psychology but manifestations of a collective unconscious or a shared environmental condition.

**Horror function:** The shared dream produces the dread of psychic contamination — the discovery that your interior states are not private, that your dreams are not your own, that the boundary between your mind and other minds has been breached. In horror, the shared dream is the invasion of interiority: something has entered the space that should be most exclusively yours (your dreams), and you are now sharing that space with entities whose presence you did not invite and cannot eject.

**Examples:** Paprika's shared dream-space (the DC Mini technology); the "collective dream" sequence in Inception; the shared hallucination in The Exterminating Angel; the collective false memory in "Candle Cove"; the shared perceptual experience in Memoria (Jessica's sound that connects her to the deep time of the landscape).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (multiple "found" videos from different sources that contain the same impossible element — the same figure, the same sound, the same anomaly — suggesting that different people in different locations are experiencing the same dream); mock-post (multiple social media accounts posting about the same inexplicable experience simultaneously).

---

**Technique 24: The Craft-Material Dream**

**Definition:** Dream-content rendered through visibly handmade or materially specific elements — cardboard, cellophane, clay, fabric, paper — that make the constructedness of the dream visible without breaking the dream's spell. The materials are humble, domestic, recognizable; the dream they compose is not. The disjunction between the material's ordinariness and the dream's strangeness is the technique's engine.

**Horror function:** The craft-material dream produces the uncanny of the familiar-made-strange — ordinary materials arranged into configurations that are not ordinary, household objects deployed in contexts that are not domestic. In horror, the craft-material dream is the handmade threat: the letter cut from magazine headlines, the doll made from found objects, the shrine assembled from domestic refuse. The horror is in the evidence of labor — someone made this, someone spent time on this, someone's hands shaped these materials into this configuration — and the labor implies intention, and the intention is unreadable.

**Examples:** Gondry's cardboard and cellophane dreams in The Science of Sleep; Švankmajer's clay and food animations; the Quays' handmade miniature worlds; Maddin's deliberate use of low-tech film materials; the craft-material aesthetic of Don't Hug Me I'm Scared.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (footage of handmade objects — drawings, models, assemblages — that are clearly the work of the recorder, presented without explanation or context); mock-post (images of craft objects that are too strange for their apparent domestic context — a mobile made of teeth, a collage of surveillance photos, a diorama of a crime scene).

---

**Technique 25: The Dying Dream**

**Definition:** A narrative that is retroactively revealed — or that gradually implies — that its events are the final dream of a dying consciousness. The entire content of the work may be the dying brain's last production: its memories, desires, regrets, and fears reassembled into a narrative that the dying person experiences as real, and that the viewer has been experiencing as reality until the revelation (or suspicion) that it is a death-dream.

**Horror function:** The dying dream produces the dread of the unreliable ground — the retroactive contamination of everything the viewer has experienced. If the narrative is a dying dream, then nothing in it was "real," and the viewer's investment in its events was invested in a dying brain's fabrication. But the horror is not that the events were unreal; it is that the boundary between the real and the dying-dream is undetectable. The viewer cannot determine, after the revelation, which moments were "real" (pre-death) and which were "dream" (post-death), because the dying dream is, by definition, indistinguishable from reality — that is its function, that is what the dying brain produces.

**Examples:** Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things (the entire film as the janitor's dying dream); Ambrose Bierce's "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" (the foundational dying-dream text, adapted by Robert Enrico in 1962); the ambiguous death-dream reading of Mulholland Drive; the possible dying dream of the final sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey; Jacob's Ladder (Adrian Lyne, 1990).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (a long-running series of uploads that gradually accumulate evidence suggesting the uploading "self" may not be alive — timestamps that contradict mortality, references to events the poster could not have survived, the gradual deterioration of the content's coherence); text-fragment (a narrative whose internal evidence increasingly suggests that the narrator died before the narrative began).

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### Director Dial Mappings

Dream cinema maps to PHANTASMATA's three director dials with a specific and revealing distribution. This domain is the native territory of the $LYNCH_DRIFT dial and constitutes the formal genealogy of Field II (Present Dreaming). However, all three dials are operative, and their interaction within dream-cinema-derived outputs is more nuanced than in any other domain in the World Research series.

#### $LYNCH_DRIFT: Primary Dial (Native Range: 50-95)

Dream cinema is, at its formal core, a $LYNCH_DRIFT phenomenon. The $LYNCH_DRIFT dial governs "dream intrusion, mundane anchor dissolution, identity blur, industrial sonic" — and the entire tradition documented in this brief is organized around these four parameters.

**Dream intrusion** is the tradition's defining operation: the dream enters the waking world (or the film enters the dream-world, which amounts to the same formal operation) through specific material techniques — the associative cut, the spatial impossibility, the duration that transforms perception, the indoor rain, the sourceless wind. Every filmmaker in this brief has developed specific techniques for engineering dream intrusion, and the inventory of those techniques is the substance of Section C.

**Mundane anchor dissolution** — the $LYNCH_DRIFT parameter that describes the progressive loss of stable reference points — is the structural arc of the dream-film tradition from Buñuel to Weerasethakul. In Buñuel, the mundane anchor is bourgeois social convention (dinner parties, social obligations), and its dissolution is satirical. In Tarkovsky, the mundane anchor is spatial coherence (the house, the landscape), and its dissolution is elegiac. In Resnais, the mundane anchor is temporal sequence (before/after, cause/effect), and its dissolution is architectural. In Weerasethakul, the mundane anchor is the boundary between the living and the dead, and its dissolution is gentle, almost hospitable. PHANTASMATA's mundane anchor is the digital interface — the phone screen, the social media feed, the video call, the notification — and its dissolution must be specific to the material properties of that interface.

**Identity blur** manifests across the tradition as: the two Conchitas (Buñuel), the mother/wife double (Tarkovsky), the X/A identity-dispute (Resnais), the Fred/Pete transformation (Lynch), the multiple Oscars (Carax), the memory-Joel who wants to diverge from the real Joel (Gondry), the janitor who dreams himself as a young intellectual (Kaufman). Dream cinema is a cinema of unstable identity because dream itself is a state of unstable identity: in a dream, you are yourself and not yourself, you are the actor and the audience, you are the dreamer and the dreamed.

$LYNCH_DRIFT at 50-60 produces the mildly oneiric — the found-digital output that is slightly wrong, that contains details that do not quite cohere, that produces a background unease without overt impossibility. This is the register of Tarkovsky's earliest oneiric gestures: the wind that has no source, the slightly-too-long hold on an ordinary surface.

At 65-80, the oneiric becomes overt — spatial impossibilities, temporal loops, identity substitutions, the dream-within-dream. This is the register of Resnais, Deren, and Gondry: the dream that is recognizable as dream, whose formal properties announce the oneiric state.

At 85-95, the distinction between dream and waking collapses entirely. This is the register of late Lynch, of Weerasethakul's Memoria, of Kaufman's dying dreams: the state in which the question "is this a dream?" has become unanswerable because the categories of dream and waking are inoperative.

#### $KON_SPIRAL: Secondary Dial (Native Range: 20-75)

Dream cinema engages $KON_SPIRAL at the specific junction where dream becomes media — where the dream's content is not "pure" unconscious imagery but imagery derived from media consumption, and where the dream's form is not "pure" dream-logic but the logic of the media environment.

**Mediation collapse** is operative in every dream-film that uses film's own formal properties (editing, framing, sound design) to render dream, because the use of cinematic technique to represent dream creates a recursive loop: the medium is used to depict the experience of being inside a medium-like state (dream), and the viewer cannot fully distinguish between the medium's operations and the dream's operations. When Deren cuts between two shots to create an associative link, the associative link is simultaneously a property of the dream (association is how dreams work) and a property of the film (editing is how films work). The dream is indistinguishable from the film because the film is the dream.

**Performance haunt** manifests in Carax's Holy Motors (Oscar's roles outliving each performance), in Kaufman's Synecdoche (the play that outlives the life it represents), and in Gondry's Eternal Sunshine (the memory-Clementine who is a performance of the real Clementine, and who develops her own desire to survive erasure).

**Obsession recursion** drives the recursive structures of Kaufman and the memory-loops of Gondry: the compulsion to return to the same images, the same memories, the same sequences, each return adding a layer of interpretation without resolving the original's meaning.

$KON_SPIRAL at 20-40 produces dream cinema in its classical mode: the dream rendered through cinematic technique, with the medium's operations visible but contained within the service of the dream. At 45-60, the mediation becomes the subject: the film is about the relationship between dream and media, and the viewer is aware that the dream they are watching is also a film watching itself dream. At 65-75, mediation collapse is operative: the dream, the film, and the viewer's perceptual state are indistinguishable, and the question "am I watching a dream or a film?" has the same structure as the question "am I dreaming or awake?"

#### $ARGENTO_GEL: Tertiary Dial (Native Range: 0-40)

Dream cinema generally operates at low $ARGENTO_GEL settings. The tradition's dominant aesthetic is muted, textured, natural — Tarkovsky's earth tones, Resnais' black-and-white severity, the Quays' twilight, Švankmajer's material grain, Weerasethakul's tropical light. Bold color, operatic violence, and high-intensity scoring are not native to the oneiric register as this tradition defines it.

However, two significant exceptions reveal productive applications:

First, Jodorowsky operates at high $ARGENTO_GEL (50-70) within an otherwise oneiric register: The Holy Mountain's saturated colors, ritual violence, and maximalist visual density combine the oneiric with the operatic. The result is a psychedelic-dream register — the dream that is not quiet and intimate (Tarkovsky) but loud and overwhelming (Jodorowsky). This register is available for PHANTASMATA outputs that combine $LYNCH_DRIFT and $ARGENTO_GEL: the video-log that is simultaneously oneiric (spatial impossibility, temporal loop) and chromatically aggressive (bold color gels, saturated saturation).

Second, Kurosawa's "Mount Fuji in Red" operates at high $ARGENTO_GEL (60-80) within a dream-anthology: the apocalyptic dream rendered through color-as-threat, where each color signifies a specific form of death. This demonstrates that $ARGENTO_GEL within the dream register functions as color-as-portent — color that is too intense, too specific, too saturated to be natural, signaling that the dream has entered a register where the visual field itself is dangerous.

$ARGENTO_GEL at 0-15 is the Tarkovskian default: earth tones, natural light, muted palette, the beauty of decay. At 20-30, selective color intrusions mark oneiric transitions — a flash of red in a sepia world, a blue light in a brown room. At 30-40, color becomes sustained and purposeful, moving from signal to atmosphere — the dream has its own palette, and the palette is vivid.

### Recommended Dial Recipes for Dream-Cinema-Derived PHANTASMATA Outputs

**Recipe 1: "The Tarkovsky Hold" (durational oneiric mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 10 (earth tones, natural light, muted)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 70 (sustained oneiric, spatial and temporal anchors softening)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 25 (low mediation awareness, the dream feels unmediated)
- Primary techniques: T03, T06, T11, T15, T20
- Primary output formats: video-log, audio-log
- Description: The found-digital output that holds a single image or ambient sound long past narrative expectation. A video-log of an empty room for four minutes. An audio-log of ambient sound in a space that gradually reveals impossible elements (indoor rain, sourceless wind). The dream rendered through patience.

**Recipe 2: "The Deren Loop" (structural oneiric mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 5 (nearly monochrome, clinical)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 75 (repetition-with-variation active, spatial impossibility operative)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 40 (moderate mediation awareness — the viewer notices the editing)
- Primary techniques: T01, T02, T05, T07, T16
- Primary output formats: video-log, screen-capture
- Description: The found-digital output structured as a loop — a video-log that repeats its opening sequence with variations, a screen-capture series that shows the same interface in progressive states of alteration. The dream rendered through structure.

**Recipe 3: "The Weerasethakul Ambient" (supernatural-as-background mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 15 (warm natural light, gentle palette)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 60 (supernatural elements present but unmarked)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 30 (low mediation awareness, documentary feel)
- Primary techniques: T17, T10, T20, T03
- Primary output formats: video-log, audio-log
- Description: The found-digital output in which impossible elements are present but unacknowledged — a figure in the background that cannot be there, a sound that has no source, a gentle impossibility treated as ambient condition. The dream rendered through the supernatural-as-normal.

**Recipe 4: "The Kaufman Recursion" (recursive oneiric mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 10 (muted, institutional, unremarkable)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 65 (identity blur active, spatial recursion)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 70 (high mediation awareness, the frame is visible, the representation represents itself)
- Primary techniques: T14, T07, T09, T16, T22
- Primary output formats: screen-capture, mock-post, text-fragment
- Description: The found-digital output that contains itself — the screenshot of the screenshot, the post about the post, the narrative that narrates itself. The dream rendered through recursion.

**Recipe 5: "The Jodorowsky Overload" (psychedelic oneiric mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 55 (bold color, saturated, chromatically aggressive)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 80 (full dream-logic, spatial and temporal impossibility)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 45 (moderate mediation awareness, the body-as-surface is primary)
- Primary techniques: T08, T10, T24, T16
- Primary output formats: video-log, mock-post
- Description: The found-digital output that is chromatically extreme — oversaturated, gel-lit, the dream rendered in colors that are too intense to be documentary. A video-log shot under colored lighting that transforms the domestic space into a ritual space. A mock-post with images that have been pushed through filters until they are barely recognizable. The dream rendered through visual excess.

### The Specific Challenge: Dream in Found-Digital Format

The central production challenge this research brief addresses is the paradox of rendering dream in formats that are indexically committed to the real. The video-log records what is in front of the camera. The screen-capture records what is on the screen. The audio-log records what is in the microphone's field. These formats are documentary by default — they present themselves as evidence of what happened, what was shown, what was heard. Dream is the opposite of documentary: it is private, unrecordable, invisible to any instrument except the dreaming mind.

The solution, as this brief demonstrates through ninety-seven years of cinematic precedent, is not to abandon the documentary premise but to contaminate it. The found-digital output does not stop being documentary; it starts being documentary about a reality that is not behaving normally. The video-log still records what is in front of the camera — but what is in front of the camera is a room where it rains indoors, a corridor that is longer than the building that contains it, a reflection that does not match. The screen-capture still records what is on the screen — but what is on the screen is a notification from the future, an algorithm that seems to read minds, a social media profile that belongs to no living person. The audio-log still records what is in the microphone's field — but what is in the microphone's field is a sound that has no source, a voice that speaks in reverse, a silence that is louder than sound.

The dream does not replace the found-digital format; it infects it. The format remains intact — the timestamps, the interface elements, the device artifacts, the recording quality — but the content it documents is oneiric. This is the Tarkovskian principle applied to digital media: you do not need to break the camera to render dream. You need only to point the camera at a reality that has begun to dream.

### Cross-References to Comparative Director Report

The comparative director report's Variable 1 ($REALITY_STATUS) maps directly to the dream cinema tradition's three primary modes of reality instability:

- **Argento's mystery-unstable reality** (the image lies while the world tells the truth) corresponds to the dream of misperception — the dream in which you see the wrong thing because your interpretive apparatus is compromised. Dream cinema equivalents: Resnais' Marienbad (is the memory real or fabricated?), Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (is the nocturnal wandering real or imagined?).

- **Lynch's ontologically-unstable reality** (the world lies while perception tells the truth) corresponds to the dream of broken reality — the dream in which the world itself malfunctions. Dream cinema equivalents: Tarkovsky's Zone (where physical laws are suspended), Deren's spatial impossibilities (where geography is discontinuous), Gondry's dissolving sets (where the environment dismantles itself).

- **Kon's media-unstable reality** (neither world nor perception lies; the distinction is inoperative) corresponds to the dream of mediation collapse — the dream that is indistinguishable from the media through which it is accessed. Dream cinema equivalents: Carax's Holy Motors (the performer who lives in roles), Kaufman's recursive frames (the representation that represents itself), Marker's Sans Soleil (the essay-film that is simultaneously travel, memory, and dream).

The blend recipes in Section D above should be read alongside the comparative director report's interaction matrix. When $LYNCH_DRIFT is primary (as it is in all dream-cinema-derived outputs), the secondary dial determines the specific flavor of the oneiric:

- $LYNCH_DRIFT + low $KON_SPIRAL + low $ARGENTO_GEL = **pure oneiric** (Tarkovsky, Weerasethakul): dream as ambient condition, unmarked, gentle, patient.
- $LYNCH_DRIFT + high $KON_SPIRAL + low $ARGENTO_GEL = **recursive oneiric** (Kaufman, Marker, Resnais): dream as structural recursion, frame-aware, intellectually vertiginous.
- $LYNCH_DRIFT + low $KON_SPIRAL + high $ARGENTO_GEL = **psychedelic oneiric** (Jodorowsky, Kurosawa's apocalyptic dreams): dream as sensory overload, chromatically extreme, ritually staged.
- $LYNCH_DRIFT + high $KON_SPIRAL + high $ARGENTO_GEL = **total oneiric** (this combination is rare in the tradition; the closest equivalent is Kon's Paprika at its most visually extreme): dream as complete mediation collapse with maximum chromatic intensity. Use sparingly in PHANTASMATA — this setting risks producing content that looks "produced" rather than "found."

## Appendix: Glossary of Terms

**Associative editing:** Editing governed by visual, sonic, or emotional resonance between shots rather than by spatial, temporal, or causal continuity. The structural principle of dream cinema from Buñuel to Weerasethakul.

**Automatism:** The surrealist principle of suppressing rational control in favor of unconscious or aleatory processes. In cinema, applied to the selection and sequencing of images according to irrational association rather than narrative logic.

**Dream-walk:** A sustained ambulatory sequence in which a character moves through space at a pace and with a quality of attention that transforms transit into oneiric experience. The movement has no destination; the walking itself is the content.

**Durational oneiric:** The rendering of dream through sustained observation of ordinary subjects, such that duration itself transforms perception and produces the oneiric effect. Associated primarily with Tarkovsky.

**Frozen gesture:** A figure arrested mid-action, held in a moment that does not complete. The temporal equivalent of the spatial impossibility.

**Haptic image:** An image that appeals to the sense of touch through closeness, texture, and ambiguity, causing the viewer's eye to move across surfaces rather than through them to represented objects. Associated with the Brothers Quay and with Laura Marks' theory of haptic visuality.

**Identity substitution:** The replacement of one actor with another (or one character with another) within a continuous narrative without acknowledgment. The dream's acceptance of the impossible made into a formal technique.

**Indoor rain:** Precipitation occurring inside an enclosed space without diegetic cause. A signature element of Tarkovsky's oneiric vocabulary, signifying the dissolution of the boundary between interior (shelter) and exterior (environment).

**Liquid mirror:** A reflective surface that yields to passage, functioning as a threshold between reality-registers. Associated with Cocteau's Orphic trilogy.

**Memory loop:** A recursive sequence in which events repeat with accumulated variation, advancing through difference while maintaining the structural form of repetition. The formal structure of dream-as-experienced.

**Oneiric:** Of, relating to, or characteristic of dreams. In cinema, used to describe formal strategies that reproduce the perceptual, temporal, spatial, and affective properties of dream experience.

**Photo-roman:** A narrative constructed from still photographs, exploiting the still image's correspondence with memory's storage of experience as discrete moments rather than continuous flow. Associated with Marker's La Jetée.

**Proleptic image:** An image that depicts events or conditions that have not yet occurred, collapsed into the present as evidence of a future that has already been documented.

**Reality-register shift:** A change in the mode of reality presented by the film — from waking to dream, from present to memory, from documentary to fiction — signaled by changes in color, texture, sound, or temporal rhythm rather than by narrative announcement.

**Recursive frame:** A narrative structure in which the work contains a representation of itself, creating a loop that prevents the identification of a stable "outermost" reality. Associated with Kaufman and with the dream-within-dream structure.

**Reverse motion:** Footage played backward, producing movement that is recognizable as movement but qualitatively wrong. Associated with Cocteau's rendering of the otherworldly and with Lynch's Black Lodge sequences.

**Tactile surrealism:** Surrealism that operates through the physical properties of materials — texture, weight, viscosity, temperature — rather than through visual impossibility or narrative irrationality. Associated with Švankmajer and the Czech surrealist tradition.

**The Zone:** A territory where the normal laws of physics and causality are suspended, entered through a threshold that marks the boundary between ordinary reality and the oneiric. From Tarkovsky's Stalker, generalized as a concept for any threshold space in dream cinema.
