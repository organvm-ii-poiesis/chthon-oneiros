## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. Giovanni Battista Piranesi: The Infinite Prison
*   **The Engine:** The Carceri d'Invenzione. Endless, interconnected staircases, arches, and machines that serve no purpose other than to dwarf the human occupant.
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *Cyclopean Scale:* Architecture that feels ancient and impossible.
    *   *The Dead End:* Staircases that lead to open air or solid walls.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Map is Infinite.* There is no "Outside" to the prison. The prison *is* the world.

### B. The Backrooms: The Liminal Non-Place
*   **The Engine:** The No-Clip. Horror found in the familiarity of empty commercial spaces (offices, malls, hallways) that have been detached from reality.
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *Fluorescent Buzz:* The steady, maddening hum of cheap lighting.
    *   *Monochrome Beige:* The absence of color as a sensory weapon.
*   **Epistemology:** *Reality is Porous.* You can "fall out" of the world and into the substrate by accident.

### C. Mark Z. Danielewski (House of Leaves): The Living Geometry
*   **The Engine:** The Internal Expansion. A house that is larger on the inside than the outside. The walls move when you aren't looking.
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *The Five-and-a-Half Minute Hallway:* A corridor that shouldn't exist but does.
    *   *Typographic Collapse:* The text itself mirrors the crumbling architecture (footnotes within footnotes).
*   **Epistemology:** *Observation Changes Geometry.* The house responds to the occupant's mental state.

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE CRUSHER PROTOCOL"

**Axiom:** Every room is a mouth.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Measurement:** The protagonist notices a spatial discrepancy (The "Atom Wider" rule from Cluster 2).
2.  **The Expansion:** A mundane door opens into an impossible, vast interior (The Piranesi Effect).
3.  **The Constriction:** The space begins to shrink or reorganize to trap the occupant.
4.  **The Fossilization:** The occupant is integrated into the wall, becoming a Class F entity.

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Ring 5 (Fossil Bed):** Use the "Crusher Protocol" as the primary hazard. The environment is actively trying to "fit" the user into its geometry.
*   **The Episodes:** Season 2 episodes must utilize **Spatial Inconsistency**—rooms that change shape between paragraphs.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Episode Fragment: "The Extension"
*Context: A user finds a new room in their studio apartment.*

The user pulls the gaming chair back to stand up.
The chair hits a wall that wasn't there five minutes ago. 
They turn around. Behind them is a hallway made of unpainted concrete. 
It smells like wet wool and old electricity (The Backrooms).
They walk for ten minutes. They find a door. 
They open it and find themselves standing on a balcony overlooking an infinite void filled with interconnected staircases. 
They look back at the door. It is gone. 
The wall behind them is pulsating. It is made of **Class F** fossils—rows of human faces turned into concrete. 
One of the faces looks like their father. It whispers: "It's a perfect fit."

## Part 5: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** Max $LYNCH_DRIFT (Spatial) + High $GRINDHOUSE (Concrete/Body).
*   **Primary Effect:** Claustrophobic Vertigo.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes the "Crusher Protocol" for the Deep Time narrative.
