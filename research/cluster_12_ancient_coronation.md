## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. Béla Tarr: The Weather of the Soul
*   **The Engine:** The Long Take as Erosion. Time is a physical force that wears down the characters and the landscape (*The Turin Horse*, *Sátántangó*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *The Wind:* A constant, howling force that strips the world bare.
    *   *The Monolith:* Characters standing still against the horizon.
    *   *Black and White:* High-contrast, but muddy—like charcoal.
*   **Epistemology:** *Entropy is Absolute.* The end of the world is not an event; it is a slow cessation of movement.

### B. Apichatpong Weerasethakul: The Jungle of Memory
*   **The Engine:** The Porous Ghost. Past, present, and future coexist in the jungle. Spirits are not scary; they are just *there* (*Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives*, *Memoria*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *The Cave:* A womb/tomb where time stops.
    *   *The Glowing Eyes:* Animals or spirits with reflective eyes in the dark.
    *   *Sleep:* Characters sleeping as a form of travel.
*   **Epistemology:** *Reincarnation is a Loop.* We are all just different forms of the same consciousness.

### C. Andrei Tarkovsky (Revisited): The Zone
*   **The Engine:** The Room Where Wishes Come True. The core of the world is a place that responds to your deepest, unspoken desires (*Stalker*, *Solaris*).
*   **Epistemology:** *The Mirror:* The core reflects the observer. If you bring fear, it destroys you. If you bring faith, it changes you.

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE ONTOLOGICAL VERTIGO"

**Axiom:** The observer creates the observed.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Arrival:** The protagonist reaches the center (Ring 6).
2.  **The Reflection:** The environment becomes a perfect mirror of the protagonist's internal state.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The "Source" speaks with the protagonist's own voice.
4.  **The Merge:** The protagonist realizes they are not the visitor; they are the architect.

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Ring 6 (Molten Core):** Use Weerasethakul's "Porous" logic. The Core is not a place; it is a memory.
*   **Episode 06:** Use Tarr's "Erosion" for the pacing. The final episode should feel incredibly slow, heavy, and inevitable.
*   **The Finale:** Use Tarkovsky's "Zone" logic. The user finds exactly what they were looking for, and it terrifies them because it reveals who they are.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Episode Fragment: "The Source Code"
*Context: The user reaches the bottom of the Fossil Bed.*

The user is standing in a cave. The walls are made of **Breathing Light** ($ARGENTO).
There is a desk in the center. It is the user's own desk.
Sitting at the desk is a figure made of pure **White Noise** (Cluster 11).
The figure turns. It has the user's face.
It says: "I've been waiting for you to type this."
The user looks at their own hands. They are typing on a keyboard that doesn't exist.
The words appearing on the screen are the script for this exact moment.

## Part 5: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** Max $LYNCH_DRIFT (Recursive Reality) + Max $KON_SPIRAL (Authorial Collapse).
*   **Primary Effect:** Total Identification.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes "Ontological Vertigo" as the final state of the project.
