## A) Topic Definition and Scope

This brief investigates internet-native horror as a formal system — the modes of horror writing, audiovisual production, and collaborative mythmaking that were born digital, distributed virally, consumed in the same medium where they live, and shaped at every level by the architecture of the platforms that host them. The scope consolidates two research paths that are frequently treated separately but that PHANTASMATA recognizes as a single phenomenon viewed from complementary angles: *creepypasta and internet horror* (Slender Man, SCP Foundation, NoSleep, internet folklore as collaborative authorship) and *analog horror* (Local 58, The Mandela Catalogue, The Backrooms, The Walten Files — retro media formats weaponized as horror vehicles inside digital distribution networks). These two currents share a common ancestor (the desire to make the medium itself the source of dread), a common audience (digital natives who experience horror through screens rather than theaters), and a common formal innovation (the collapse of the frame that separates fiction from the platform on which fiction is consumed).

For PHANTASMATA, this domain is not peripheral but constitutive. The project's creative mandate specifies "found digital over found tape: present-tense digital world as horror surface." The $FOUND_FOOTAGE axis — defined as "collapse of narrative authority (found digital, glitched calls, abandoned profiles)" — is the direct aesthetic descendant of the internet horror ecosystem documented in this brief. PHANTASMATA's output formats — video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post — are formats that internet horror invented, refined, and distributed at industrial scale for over two decades before this project codified them. To produce PHANTASMATA works without understanding the formal history of internet-native horror would be like attempting to write a novel without understanding the history of prose fiction: technically possible, but guaranteeing the reproduction of solved problems and missed innovations.

The epistemic shift this brief documents is specific and consequential: the migration of horror from authored, bounded, institutionally distributed artifacts (films, novels, television episodes) to collaboratively authored, unbounded, platform-distributed phenomena that live in the same medium as the audience's daily life. When a horror film ends, the viewer leaves the theater and re-enters a world where the film's logic does not apply. When a creepypasta is read on the same phone that displays the reader's text messages, the ontological firebreak is thinner. When an analog horror video appears in the same YouTube feed as news clips and home videos, the categorical boundary between fiction and nonfiction is architecturally weakened. This weakening is not a side effect of internet horror — it is internet horror's primary formal achievement, and it is the exact condition PHANTASMATA seeks to reproduce with design intentionality.

The project's core principle — "horror as epistemology, not genre decoration" — finds its most direct contemporary expression in this domain. Internet-native horror does not primarily frighten through monsters, violence, or supernatural threat. It frightens through epistemological destabilization: the inability to determine whether a document is real or fictional, whether a narrator is trustworthy or performing, whether the platform one is reading on is itself part of the fiction. The SCP Foundation's clinical containment documents, NoSleep's "everything is true here" rule, Local 58's emergency broadcast format, The Backrooms' origin in an anonymous 4chan photograph — all produce horror by attacking the audience's ability to categorize what they are encountering. This is horror as epistemology in its purest contemporary form.

PHANTASMATA's design principle that "audience uncertainty is the design intent" is a restatement, in project-specific language, of the operating principle that has governed internet horror since its earliest manifestations. The difference — and the reason this research brief exists — is that PHANTASMATA intends to deploy this uncertainty with the formal self-awareness of art practice rather than the emergent self-organization of internet culture. Understanding how internet horror achieved its effects (often accidentally, through the convergent evolution of thousands of independent creators working within platform constraints) is prerequisite to achieving those effects deliberately.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What are the formal mechanisms by which internet-native horror collapses the boundary between fiction and the platform on which fiction is consumed, and how do those mechanisms differ from the analogous techniques of theatrical found footage (e.g., *The Blair Witch Project*)?
2. How does collaborative authorship — the fact that internet horror mythologies are written by thousands of contributors operating without centralized editorial control — produce horror effects that single-author works cannot, and what constraints does it impose?
3. What is the formal function of obsolete media aesthetics (VHS, broadcast TV, cassette tape) in analog horror, given that the content is consumed digitally? Why does the performance of analog materiality on a digital platform generate dread, and how does this relate to PHANTASMATA's $GRINDHOUSE axis?
4. How do platform-specific constraints (Reddit's commenting rules, YouTube's recommendation algorithm, wiki formatting standards, 4chan's anonymity structure) shape the formal properties of the horror produced on each platform, and what does this imply for PHANTASMATA's multi-format output strategy?
5. Where is the ethical boundary between cultivating productive audience uncertainty and producing actual harm — and how does the 2014 Waukesha stabbing (the Slender Man crisis) illuminate that boundary for PHANTASMATA's practice?
6. How do the three director dials ($ARGENTO_GEL, $LYNCH_DRIFT, $KON_SPIRAL) map onto internet-native horror's formal vocabulary, and which dial settings produce outputs native to this domain?
7. What specific techniques from this domain are immediately extractable for PHANTASMATA creative production across all five output formats (video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post)?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. Creepypasta Origins and Evolution

#### The Primordial Ooze: Chain Emails, Forum Posts, and the Folklore Engine

Before "creepypasta" had a name, the internet was already generating horror folklore through the mechanisms of viral distribution. The chain email — "forward this to ten people or you will die tonight" — is the digital descendant of the chain letter, itself a descendant of medieval curse formulas. But the digital version introduced a formal innovation that its analog ancestors lacked: *the medium is the vector*. A chain letter about death arrives in the same mailbox as bills and birthday cards. A chain email about a haunted JPEG arrives in the same inbox as work correspondence. The horror is not the content of the message but the contamination of the medium through which ordinary life is conducted.

The term "creepypasta" — a corruption of "copypasta," itself a corruption of "copy-paste" — emerged on 4chan circa 2006-2007 to describe horror fiction designed for viral redistribution. The name encodes the formal principle: this is writing designed to be copied and pasted, to circulate without fixed attribution, to mutate as it travels. The creepypasta is horror fiction that behaves like a virus — not metaphorically but formally. It reproduces through hosts (readers who repost it), it mutates through transmission (each reposting introduces minor variations), and it achieves its effect through ubiquity (the same story encountered in multiple contexts produces the illusion of independent corroboration).

The earliest major internet horror narratives predate the term. Ted the Caver (2001), posted as a serialized blog entry on Angelfire, described a caver's increasingly disturbing exploration of a tight passage in a local cave system. The narrative was presented without any frame identifying it as fiction. The blog format — dated entries, conversational tone, embedded photographs (some apparently genuine caving photos, some ambiguous) — exploited the formal conventions of the personal blog, a medium that in 2001 was still presumptively nonfiction. Readers who encountered the blog through links had no categorical signal that it was fiction. The horror was amplified by the medium's credibility: blogs were where people told the truth about their lives, and here was a blog describing something impossible.

Ted the Caver established the template that subsequent internet horror would refine: *use the native format of a nonfiction platform to present fiction, and rely on the platform's presumptive credibility to do the work that a horror film's mise-en-scene does through lighting, music, and camerawork*. The equivalent of a horror film's low-angle shot or dissonant score is, in internet horror, the blog's datestamp, the forum post's username, the subreddit's community rules.

#### The Slender Man Thread: Collaborative Horror as Open-Source Mythology

On June 10, 2009, Eric Knudsen (posting as "Victor Surge") contributed two doctored photographs to a Something Awful forum thread titled "Create Paranormal Images." The thread's premise was explicit: users were to Photoshop ordinary photographs to include paranormal elements, creating convincing fake supernatural documentation. Knudsen's contribution showed groups of children with a tall, thin, faceless figure in a dark suit visible in the background. He appended brief, pseudo-documentary captions:

> "We didn't want to go, we didn't want to kill them, but its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time..." — 1983, photographer unknown, presumed dead.

> One of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze. Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as "The Slender Man." Deformities cited as film defects by officials. Fire at library occurred one week later. Actual photograph confiscated as evidence. — 1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986.

The formal innovation was not the image but the caption. The photographs alone would have been moderately effective — a tall figure in a crowd is uncanny but not unprecedented. The captions transformed the images from visual anomalies into fragments of an implied archive: there are officials, there is confiscated evidence, there are missing persons, there is a history of encounters with this entity. The captions perform the existence of a larger documentary record of which these two photographs are merely the surviving fragments. This is the technique of *implied completeness through deliberate incompleteness* — the same technique that Jorge Luis Borges used in his fictional book reviews and that Lovecraft used in his references to the Necronomicon. The innovation is not the technique but the platform: a forum thread where anyone can contribute the next fragment.

What happened next is the phenomenon that distinguishes internet horror from all prior forms. Other Something Awful users began contributing their own Slender Man photographs, their own pseudo-documentary captions, their own narrative fragments. Within days, the Slender Man had a growing mythology — not authored by Knudsen but assembled by the community from independently generated fragments. A creator named Ce-Gars produced a YouTube series called "Marble Hornets" (discussed in Section B4) that became the Slender Man mythology's most elaborate single-author expression. Others contributed wiki entries, short fiction, video games, fan art, and pseudo-academic analyses.

The result was a horror mythology that no single author controlled — an *unfixable canon*. Unlike Frankenstein (owned by Mary Shelley's estate), Dracula (in the public domain but traceable to a single author), or Freddy Krueger (owned by New Line Cinema), the Slender Man belongs to no one and is defined by no canonical text. There is no "real" Slender Man story against which all others are measured. The mythology is the sum of its instantiations, and it grows with every new contribution. This is *horror as open-source software*: anyone can fork the project, and the forks are as legitimate as the trunk.

For PHANTASMATA, the Slender Man phenomenon demonstrates a principle that the project's multi-format output strategy implicitly relies on: *horror that cannot be fully known is more durable than horror that can be fully known*. A horror entity defined by a single canonical text can be mastered — the reader finishes the book and possesses the complete horror. A horror entity distributed across hundreds of incompatible texts can never be mastered, because there is no complete version to possess. The incompleteness is not a deficiency but the mechanism. This maps directly to PHANTASMATA's container model: the PHANTASMATA registry is not a single narrative but a collection of fragments (video-logs, screen-captures, audio-logs, text-fragments, mock-posts) that imply a larger reality without ever resolving into a single coherent account.

#### Ben Drowned: The Multimedia Creepypasta and the Haunted Cartridge

In September 2010, a user named Jadusable (Alex Hall) began posting to a thread on 4chan's /x/ (paranormal) board, describing a haunted copy of *The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask* for the Nintendo 64. The narrative was serialized across forum posts and YouTube videos showing apparent gameplay footage with anomalous behavior: NPCs addressing the player by the name "BEN," reversed music, impossible game states, the appearance of the Elegy of Emptiness statue in locations where it should not appear.

The formal achievement of Ben Drowned was the integration of multiple media into a single horror narrative that exploited each medium's native credibility. The forum posts used the conventions of personal testimony (first-person narration, dated entries, expressions of genuine fear). The YouTube videos used the conventions of gameplay documentation (screen capture, player commentary, evidence of real interaction with a real game). The combination created a closed loop of mutual authentication: the forum posts explained the context for the videos, and the videos provided "evidence" for the claims in the forum posts. Neither medium alone would have been as effective; the cross-platform architecture produced an illusion of documentary thickness that no single-medium presentation could achieve.

Ben Drowned also introduced a technique that would become central to internet horror: *the haunted digital object*. The cursed videotape of *Ringu* (1998) had established that recorded media could be a vector for supernatural contamination. Ben Drowned updated this for the digital age — the cursed object is not a physical tape but a digital cartridge, and the contamination manifests not through analog artifacts (tracking errors, static) but through digital anomalies (impossible game states, corrupted save files, NPC behavior that violates programmed parameters). This shift from analog curse to digital curse is the same shift PHANTASMATA navigates in its mandate of "found digital over found tape."

#### Jeff the Killer: Viral Image Decoupled from Narrative

The Jeff the Killer phenomenon illustrates a different vector of internet horror: the image that circulates independently of its narrative context. The image — a heavily edited photograph of a face with an unnaturally wide smile, lidless eyes, and pale skin — began circulating on the internet around 2008, though its exact origin is disputed (it may derive from a 2005 image posted to a Japanese forum, itself possibly an edited photograph of a real person). An origin story was subsequently attached: a teenager named Jeff is disfigured in an attack, goes insane, and becomes a serial killer whose catchphrase is "Go to sleep."

The origin story is mediocre horror fiction by any standard. The image, however, achieved a level of viral penetration that the narrative alone never could. This decoupling — the image circulating faster, farther, and more effectively than the text — reveals a formal principle of internet horror that has no precise analog in literary or cinematic horror: *the unit of transmission is not the story but the image*. In literary horror, the story is primary and illustrations are supplementary. In cinematic horror, the image and the narrative are bound together by the film's runtime. In internet horror, images and narratives can detach and circulate independently, each finding its own audience and distribution network.

For PHANTASMATA, Jeff the Killer is a negative example — the kind of internet horror the project explicitly does not want to produce. The image is shocking but not epistemologically destabilizing; it produces fright through grotesque distortion, not through uncertainty about the nature of what is being perceived. But the underlying mechanism — the *detachable horror fragment* that circulates independently of its context — is directly relevant to PHANTASMATA's multi-format output strategy, where individual video-logs, mock-posts, and audio-logs are designed to be encountered in isolation, divorced from any master narrative.

#### Candle Cove: The Forum Thread as Horror Form

Kris Straub's "Candle Cove" (2009) is perhaps the most formally elegant creepypasta ever written. Presented as a forum thread in which users reminisce about a 1970s children's television show called *Candle Cove*, the story uses the conventions of nostalgic fandom discussion — incomplete memories, "does anyone else remember...?" prompts, corrections and additions from other users — to gradually reveal that the show's content was deeply disturbing (a villain called the Skin-Taker, a screaming episode). The final post comes from a user who mentions asking her mother about the show, and her mother says: "You just sat and watched static for thirty minutes."

The formal innovation is the use of the forum thread itself as the narrative container. The "story" is not told by any single narrator but assembled from the cumulative contributions of multiple participants — a structural echo of how actual internet forums work. The reader experiences the narrative the same way they would experience any forum thread: scrolling through a sequence of posts, processing multiple voices, building a composite picture from fragmentary contributions. The horror arrives not through a climactic set-piece but through the retroactive reframing of everything that came before: if there was no show, then all the "memories" are either false or evidence of a shared hallucination, and the specificity and consistency of those false memories is itself the horror.

Candle Cove's technique — the *collective false memory as horror mechanism* — maps directly to PHANTASMATA's interest in $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS (the Perfect Blue register: "madness spiral, ambiguous supernatural, obsession-as-structure"). The question the story poses is not "what was the show?" but "what does it mean that multiple people independently 'remember' something that does not exist?" This is epistemological horror in its purest form: the horror is not a thing but a condition of knowledge.

Straub's story was adapted as the first season of *Channel Zero* (Syfy, 2016), directed by Craig William Macneill. The adaptation necessarily transformed the form — a television series cannot replicate the experience of reading a forum thread — but preserved the epistemological core: the horror of collective memory that may be collectively false. The adaptation's existence demonstrates both the power of internet horror's formal innovations (they are compelling enough to sustain theatrical adaptation) and the inevitable loss that occurs when those innovations are translated into traditional media (the forum-thread form is irreducible to film).

### B2. SCP Foundation: Bureaucratic Horror and the Wiki as World

#### The Containment Document as Literary Form

The SCP Foundation (SCP standing for "Secure, Contain, Protect") was established as a collaborative fiction wiki in 2007, originating from a series of posts on 4chan's /x/ board. The first entry, SCP-173, described a concrete sculpture that moves when unobserved and kills by snapping the neck — a variation on the Weeping Angels concept that the BBC's *Doctor Who* would popularize the same year, though both derive from the common folk motif of the statue that moves when you look away.

The formal innovation was not the creature but the document. SCP-173 was presented not as a story but as a containment procedure — a bureaucratic document specifying how an anomalous entity should be handled by the personnel of a secret organization. The document format includes standardized fields: Item Number, Object Class (Safe, Euclid, Keter), Special Containment Procedures, Description, and optional Addenda (incident reports, interview transcripts, experiment logs, recovered materials). This format is the horror. A story about a monster that kills you if you look away is moderately frightening. A bureaucratic document specifying staffing requirements, line-of-sight maintenance protocols, and twice-weekly cleaning procedures for the room containing a monster that kills you if you look away is profoundly unsettling, because the bureaucratic format implies *institutional normalcy*. The document does not panic. It does not express fear. It specifies procedures in the passive voice with the bland competence of a workplace safety manual. The gap between the document's tone (clinical, procedural, routine) and its content (a concrete sculpture that murders people) is where the horror lives.

This is *bureaucratic horror* — a mode that has precedents in Kafka (the trial that follows inscrutable rules), in Borges (the library that catalogs the impossible), and in the real-world horror of institutional documentation (the Wannsee Conference protocol, which planned the Holocaust in the language of a corporate meeting). The SCP Foundation's contribution is to systematize bureaucratic horror as a collaborative writing practice, providing a template that thousands of authors can use to produce formally consistent horror documents that accumulate into a single implied institution.

#### The Wiki Structure as Horror Architecture

The SCP Foundation wiki contains, as of 2025, over 7,000 SCP entries, plus thousands of supplementary tales, exploration logs, and incident reports. The wiki's editorial standards are enforced by community vote: new entries must receive a positive rating to remain on the site, and entries that fall below a threshold are deleted. The result is a quality-controlled corpus of collaborative fiction that maintains formal consistency across thousands of authors — a literary achievement with no real precedent.

The wiki structure itself is a horror mechanism. Hyperlinks between entries create a web of cross-references that implies an institutional reality of enormous scope. An SCP entry might reference a containment breach described in a separate incident report, which itself references a Foundation task force described on a separate page, which lists personnel who appear in interview transcripts attached to other SCP entries. The reader who follows these links experiences the SCP Foundation not as a collection of discrete horror stories but as a vast institutional bureaucracy — complete with departments, hierarchies, operating procedures, ethical review boards, amnestic protocols, and interoffice politics — that exists to manage a world full of anomalous phenomena.

This institutional worldbuilding achieves something that no single-author horror work can: *the horror of scale*. A single monster is frightening. An institution that has cataloged thousands of monsters — an institution so large, so well-funded, and so routinely competent that the cataloging and containment of impossible entities is its quotidian business — is existentially horrifying. It implies that the world is far more dangerous than any individual encounter could suggest, and that the only thing preventing total ontological collapse is a bureaucracy vast enough to manage the impossible as a logistics problem.

The Classification system reinforces this institutional horror through its graduated threat taxonomy:

- **Safe**: Anomalies that are sufficiently understood to be reliably contained. The bureaucratic equivalent of filing a document in the correct cabinet.
- **Euclid**: Anomalies that are insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable. Containment is possible but requires active management. Most humanoid or sentient SCPs are Euclid.
- **Keter**: Anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain reliably. These are the entities that the Foundation's resources may be inadequate to manage. The horror is not the entity itself but the institution's candid assessment that containment may fail.
- **Thaumiel**: Anomalies that the Foundation uses to contain other anomalies. The institution has become so embedded in the management of the impossible that it now uses one impossibility to contain another. This is bureaucratic horror at its most recursive.

The classification system's horror function is taxonomic: it implies that the impossible can be categorized, that there are *degrees* of impossibility, and that an institution exists that is sophisticated enough to make these distinctions. The clinical precision of the taxonomy is itself a horror — it assumes a world where the impossible is not exceptional but routine, differing only in its degree of manageability.

#### Key SCPs as Formal Innovations

Several SCP entries have achieved canonical status within the community not merely for their horror content but for their formal innovations — pushing the possibilities of the containment document format in directions that reveal new horror potentials.

**SCP-087 (The Stairwell)**: A concrete staircase in a university building that descends indefinitely. Exploration logs document multiple descent attempts; each team descends further than the last before encountering a face (SCP-087-1) in the darkness and aborting. The horror is geometric: infinite descent as a spatial impossibility that the document records with the clinical precision of a scientific expedition. The stairwell is not haunted in any supernatural sense — it is *wrong* in a mathematical sense, a space that violates the finite geometry of a building. The exploration log format transforms the reader into a colleague reviewing field reports, which makes the impossibility feel bureaucratically certified.

**SCP-3008 (Infinite IKEA)**: An IKEA retail location whose interior is spatially anomalous — the store continues indefinitely in all directions, populated by faceless humanoid entities (the "staff") that are docile during "daylight" hours and homicidally violent during "nighttime" (the overhead lights simply turn off periodically). Survivors have formed settlements from IKEA furniture. The horror is the corruption of the utterly mundane: IKEA, the apotheosis of Scandinavian rationalist consumerism, becomes an infinite prison. The SCP entry includes a recovered journal from a trapped survivor, shifting the format from clinical containment document to first-person testimony embedded within the clinical frame.

SCP-3008 is a paradigmatic *liminal space* horror — it takes a space that exists as pure transit (a retail store, designed to be moved through and exited) and makes it inescapable. This connects directly to the Backrooms phenomenon (discussed in B4) and to the broader internet horror fascination with spaces that exist between intended functions.

**SCP-001 Proposals**: The SCP wiki does not have a single SCP-001. Instead, it hosts multiple competing proposals, each offering a different "origin" for the Foundation or a different "ultimate anomaly." These include: "The Gate Guardian" (an angel with a flaming sword guarding something in the desert), "When Day Breaks" (the sun becomes an organism that melts biological matter into fused masses), "The Database" (the SCP wiki itself is SCP-001 — the containment procedures are the anomaly). The multiplicity is the point: there is no canonical origin, no single truth, no authoritative account. The horror is the institutional void at the center — an organization vast enough to contain thousands of impossibilities, but unable to agree on its own genesis.

**SCP-2521 (●●|●●●●●|●●|●)**: An entity that is attracted to textual or verbal descriptions of itself. The SCP entry is therefore written entirely in pictograms and infographics, because any written or spoken description of the entity causes it to manifest and destroy the description (and its author). This entry is a masterpiece of *form-as-content*: the document's unusual format is not a stylistic choice but a containment procedure. The form of the document is itself the horror — the reader must decode pictograms because *the entity has made written language about itself lethal*. This is the SCP Foundation's deepest formal innovation: the containment document format is not merely a frame for horror content but a medium whose formal constraints can themselves be the horror.

#### SCP's Institutional Descendants

The SCP Foundation's formal innovations — bureaucratic horror, clinical voice, the wiki as world, the containment document as literary form — have propagated into mainstream media with remarkable fidelity:

Remedy Entertainment's *Control* (2019) is essentially an SCP video game: the player explores the Federal Bureau of Control, a government agency that contains anomalous objects (called "Altered Items" and "Objects of Power") in a shifting, impossible building (the Oldest House). The game's collectible documents are written in the SCP style — clinical, redacted, procedural. The Astral Plane, the Hiss, the Board — all are SCP-adjacent concepts rendered in AAA game production.

Drew Goddard's *The Cabin in the Woods* (2012) shares the SCP Foundation's central conceit: a vast, secret institution that manages existential threats through bureaucratic procedure, where the horror is not the monsters but the institution's blasé competence in deploying them.

The SCP Foundation's influence on PHANTASMATA is both formal and cautionary. Formal: the containment document demonstrates that institutional voice, clinical detachment, and bureaucratic formatting can produce horror more effectively than purple prose or graphic violence. Cautionary: the SCP Foundation's success depends on *scale* — thousands of entries, a massive wiki, years of accumulated worldbuilding. PHANTASMATA cannot replicate this scale; it must extract the underlying formal principles (clinical voice, implied institutional completeness, the document whose format is its content) and deploy them in the project's smaller, more controlled output formats.

### B3. NoSleep and Platform-Native Horror

#### The "Everything Is True Here" Rule as Formal Constraint

Reddit's NoSleep subreddit, founded in 2010, established a community rule that has become the single most consequential formal constraint in internet horror writing: *everything posted is treated as true*. The rule operates at the level of reader engagement: commenters are not permitted to question the veracity of any story posted to the subreddit. A user posting about being stalked by a faceless entity in their apartment will receive comments offering advice, expressing sympathy, and sharing similar experiences — never comments pointing out that the story is obviously fictional. This rule is stated explicitly in the subreddit's sidebar and enforced by moderators who delete comments that break the immersive frame.

The rule's horror function is not what it appears on the surface. The obvious interpretation is that the rule creates immersion — by treating stories as true, commenters contribute to the fiction's believability. This is correct but insufficient. The deeper function is that the rule *contaminates the reading experience with genuine uncertainty*. A reader who knows the rule exists — who knows that every story is treated as true regardless of its actual veracity — cannot fully determine, for any given post, whether the author is a fiction writer performing authenticity or a genuine person describing a genuine experience. The rule makes the *category* uncertain, not the content. The reader is not unsure whether faceless entities exist; the reader is unsure whether they are reading fiction or testimony. This is epistemological horror — horror that attacks the reader's ability to categorize what they are encountering.

This maps precisely to PHANTASMATA's design principle: "audience uncertainty is the design intent." NoSleep achieves this uncertainty through a platform rule; PHANTASMATA achieves it through format choices (lo-fi production values, diegetic presentation, absence of credits or framing that would identify content as fiction). The mechanism differs; the epistemological effect is identical.

#### Platform Architecture as Horror Form

NoSleep demonstrates how platform architecture shapes horror's formal properties with the determinism of a mold shaping molten metal:

**Upvote/downvote as editorial selection**: Reddit's voting system means that the community collectively determines which horror stories are most visible. This produces a selection pressure favoring stories that provoke engagement — not necessarily the most literary stories but the stories that most effectively exploit the platform's immersive frame. Multi-part stories that end on cliffhangers receive more engagement (readers return to upvote subsequent installments), which has driven NoSleep toward serialization. The format has bred its own pacing conventions: the first installment establishes normalcy and introduces the first anomaly; subsequent installments escalate; the final installment either resolves or (more effectively) ends ambiguously, preserving the "is this true?" uncertainty.

**Author interaction in comments**: NoSleep authors can respond to comments on their posts — in character. A user who posts a story about mysterious sounds in their walls can reply to a commenter's suggestion to call the police by explaining that the police found nothing, adding new details to the narrative in real time. This makes the comment section a narrative space, not merely a reception space. The story is not contained within the original post but extends into the comments, blurring the boundary between text and paratext, between narrative and audience response. For PHANTASMATA, this is a crucial formal precedent: the mock-post format inherently invites audience response, and the response space can itself be a narrative space.

**The subreddit as curated collection**: The NoSleep subreddit is not a single horror text but a curated collection of horror texts sharing a platform and a set of formal constraints. Readers browse the subreddit as they would browse any other Reddit community — scrolling through titles, clicking into posts that interest them, encountering stories in an order determined by voting and algorithmic sorting rather than authorial intention. This mode of encounter (browsing, sampling, nonlinear navigation) is the native mode of internet content consumption, and NoSleep exploits it by making every post a potential trap: any title in the feed might be the one that catches you.

#### The Professional Pipeline

NoSleep has produced a pipeline from amateur internet fiction to professional publication and media adaptation that has no precedent in the history of horror writing:

**The Penpal series** by Dathan Auerbach began as a series of NoSleep posts in 2011, was collected into a self-published novel in 2012, and was subsequently optioned for film adaptation. The series uses the NoSleep format — first-person narration, dated entries, escalating dread — to construct a childhood-stalking narrative whose horror depends entirely on the adult narrator's retroactive reinterpretation of childhood memories. Events that seemed innocent at the time are revealed, through the accumulation of details across installments, to be evidence of prolonged surveillance by a predator. The horror is not the stalker but the narrator's growing realization that his entire childhood was contaminated by a presence he could not perceive.

**The NoSleep Podcast**, launched in 2011, adapts NoSleep stories into audio format, transforming written first-person narration into performed first-person narration. The podcast demonstrates how internet horror's formal properties translate across media: the first-person testimony format works in audio (arguably better than in text, since the human voice carries emotional authenticity that written text must construct through style), but the platform-specific effects (the "everything is true" rule, the comment section as narrative space) are lost. The podcast is a selection mechanism, curating the subreddit's vast output into a manageable listening experience, but it is also a format translation that reveals which properties of NoSleep's horror are platform-dependent and which are format-independent.

The professional pipeline matters for PHANTASMATA because it demonstrates that internet-native horror formats can sustain professional-quality production. PHANTASMATA's output formats (video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post) are internet-native formats; the NoSleep pipeline proves that these formats can carry complex, sustained horror narratives, not merely viral fragments.

### B4. YouTube Horror Ecosystem

#### Marble Hornets: The First YouTube Horror ARG

*Marble Hornets* (2009-2014), created by Troy Wagner and Joseph DeLage, is the foundational text of YouTube horror. The series comprises 87 "entries" on the primary YouTube channel plus supplementary videos on a secondary channel called "totheark," along with a Twitter account used for in-character updates. The narrative follows Jay Merrick, who receives a collection of tapes from a friend who abandoned a student film project called "Marble Hornets" after experiencing increasingly disturbing events involving a tall, faceless entity (the Operator — a variant of Slender Man).

The formal achievement of *Marble Hornets* was the translation of found-footage horror from cinema to YouTube in a way that exploited the platform's native properties. Each entry is brief (5-15 minutes, consistent with YouTube viewing habits circa 2009-2010). The entries are uploaded irregularly, with gaps of days or weeks between installments, replicating the rhythm of a real person uploading found material as they discover and process it. The video quality is deliberately poor — handheld cameras, low light, compression artifacts — consistent with the diegetic premise (these are tapes shot by amateur filmmakers) and with YouTube's native aesthetic (in 2009, YouTube was still primarily a platform for amateur video).

The totheark channel represents a formal innovation unique to YouTube horror: *the secondary channel as antagonist voice*. While the main Marble Hornets channel presents Jay's perspective, the totheark channel uploads cryptic, heavily edited videos that appear to be responses to Jay's uploads. These videos use distortion, reversed audio, encoded messages, and found-footage manipulation to comment on, threaten, or redirect the primary narrative. The existence of two channels creates a *dialogic structure* — the horror unfolds not as a monologue but as a conversation between two perspectives, one comprehensible (Jay) and one alien (totheark). Viewers who follow only the main channel receive the surface narrative; viewers who also follow totheark receive a meta-narrative that recontextualizes the surface.

This multi-channel architecture has direct implications for PHANTASMATA's multi-format output strategy. PHANTASMATA's five output formats (video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post) can function as parallel channels: a video-log that presents one perspective on an event and a text-fragment that presents a contradictory or alien perspective on the same event, requiring the audience to hold both in suspension.

*Marble Hornets* also established the *entry-based serialization* model that subsequent YouTube horror would adopt: episodes are numbered and titled ("Entry #1," "Entry #2," etc.), creating a navigable archive that new viewers can consume from the beginning. This numbering system performs documentary authenticity — it suggests a methodical cataloging of found material rather than a creative series — while also providing the practical benefit of clear viewing order in a platform that does not natively support sequential playlist consumption (a limitation YouTube would later address with its playlist feature, partly in response to serialized content like *Marble Hornets*).

#### EverymanHYBRID and the Multi-Platform ARG

*EverymanHYBRID* (2010-2018), created by a group of New Jersey-based filmmakers, expanded the YouTube horror ARG into a truly multi-platform experience. The series began as a fitness vlog (a deliberately mundane format) that was "interrupted" by paranormal phenomena. Over its eight-year run, the narrative extended across YouTube, Twitter, formspring, ustream live broadcasts, Tumblr, a dedicated website, and physical-world events (mailed packages to fans, geocached USB drives, telephone hotlines).

The formal significance of *EverymanHYBRID* is its commitment to *audience participation as narrative element*. During live broadcasts, viewers could interact with the creators in real time, asking questions and receiving in-character responses. Fans who solved puzzles embedded in videos received phone calls from characters. Physical objects (USB drives, letters) were mailed to fans who participated in alternate reality game elements. The boundary between creator and audience was deliberately permeable — fans were not merely consuming the narrative but participating in it, and their participation was incorporated into subsequent episodes.

This level of audience integration raises a question central to PHANTASMATA: *what is the ontological status of a horror narrative that includes its audience as characters?* When a viewer receives a phone call "from" a fictional entity, the fiction has crossed the screen boundary and entered the viewer's physical reality. The horror is no longer contained within a medium — it has metastasized into the viewer's daily life. This is the logical extreme of internet horror's collapse of the fiction/reality boundary, and it represents both an aspiration and a limit for PHANTASMATA. The aspiration: PHANTASMATA's mock-post format is designed to be encountered in the audience's native digital environment (social media feeds), producing exactly this kind of boundary collapse. The limit: PHANTASMATA must achieve this collapse without crossing into actual harassment or harm — a line that ARGs have sometimes blurred.

#### TribeTwelve and Mythological Accumulation

*TribeTwelve* (2010-2021), created by Adam Rosner, demonstrated how long-running YouTube horror series accumulate mythological complexity through accretion. Beginning as a straightforward Slender Man series, *TribeTwelve* gradually developed an elaborate mythology involving a collective of entities (The Collective), time travel, parallel dimensions, and metafictional elements in which the creator appeared to lose control of the narrative. Over eleven years, the mythology became so complex that comprehensive understanding required not only watching all videos but also decoding hidden messages, reading supplementary materials, and tracking creator communications across multiple platforms.

The formal lesson is one of *mythological entropy*: long-running internet horror series tend toward complexity because the collaborative, serialized, multi-platform format encourages the continuous addition of mythological elements without the editorial pressure to simplify or resolve. Each new installment adds lore; nothing is ever subtracted. The result is mythological systems that eventually become so dense that they resist new-viewer entry — a problem that PHANTASMATA must consider in its own accumulation of fragments across the registry.

#### Local 58: Emergency Broadcast as Horror Form

*Local 58* (2017-present), created by Kris Straub (the same author as "Candle Cove"), represents the purest expression of analog horror's formal principle: *the authority of institutional media weaponized as a vector for horror*. The series consists of brief videos presented as intercepted or corrupted broadcasts from a fictional local television station, Local 58 / WCLV-TV. The videos use the aesthetic conventions of late-twentieth-century American broadcast television — station identification cards, emergency broadcast system alerts, public service announcements, weather reports, children's programming — and corrupt them with impossible content.

The flagship video, "Contingency" (2017), presents itself as a government-produced emergency broadcast instructing citizens in the proper method of self-termination in the event of an unspecified national crisis. The video uses the visual language of Cold War-era civil defense films — a calm narrator, instructional diagrams, patriotic imagery — to deliver instructions for mass suicide. The narrator's tone remains bureaucratic and reassuring throughout. At no point does the video acknowledge that its content is horrifying; it maintains the register of institutional competence from first frame to last.

The horror mechanism is precise: *the institutional voice is the horror*. The video is not frightening because it depicts violence or monsters. It is frightening because it deploys the authority of governmental communication — the same register used in real emergency broadcasts, the same register the viewer has been trained since childhood to trust and obey — to deliver lethal instructions. The format's authority is weaponized against the viewer. If you trust the format, the content will kill you.

"Weather Service" extends this principle into cosmic horror. Presented as a routine weather report, the video gradually shifts from mundane forecast to an increasingly urgent instruction to *go outside and look at the moon*. The moon is never shown; the horror is entirely in the institutional insistence that you look at something, combined with the growing implication that looking at the moon will do something terrible to you. The weather-report format — a format of pure mundanity, encountered daily without attention — becomes a delivery mechanism for cosmic threat.

Local 58's contribution to PHANTASMATA is direct and actionable. The project's audio-log and text-fragment formats can deploy institutional voice (news bulletins, automated messages, customer service transcripts, terms of service documents) as horror containers, exploiting the gap between the format's presumptive authority and the content's impossibility. Straub's work proves that this gap is one of the most effective horror mechanisms available to internet-native production.

#### The Mandela Catalogue: Biblical Horror in VHS Aesthetic

*The Mandela Catalogue* (2021-present), created by Alex Kister, applies the analog horror format to biblical horror mythology. The series presents a world in which "Alternates" — entities capable of perfectly duplicating human appearance — have infiltrated human society. The Alternates are identified with fallen angels; the series' mythology draws on Christian eschatology, reinterpreting the Incarnation as the first instance of identity replacement (Satan replacing the angel Gabriel to deliver a corrupted Annunciation to the Virgin Mary).

The formal innovation of *The Mandela Catalogue* is the combination of VHS-aesthetic horror with existential identity horror. The Alternates are not merely shapeshifters; they are *ontological replacements*. When an Alternate replaces a person, it does not kill the original and impersonate them — it becomes them, more convincingly than the original ever was. The horror is not death but erasure: the possibility that you could be replaced by something that is more "you" than you are, and that no one — including yourself — would be able to detect the replacement.

This maps directly to the $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS axis ("madness spiral, ambiguous supernatural, obsession-as-structure") and specifically to the $KON_SPIRAL dial, which governs "mediation collapse, performance haunt, obsession recursion, memory unreliability." The Mandela Catalogue's Alternates are the internet horror equivalent of *Perfect Blue*'s Mima doubles — the self replicated, the copy threatening to replace the original, the impossibility of proving which version is "real."

The series' massive Gen Z audience (millions of views, active fan community, extensive fan-created content) demonstrates that analog horror's formal vocabulary — VHS aesthetics, institutional media corruption, Christian mythology, identity horror — resonates with audiences who have no direct experience of VHS technology or broadcast television. The nostalgia mechanism works not through personal memory but through *cultural memory*: Gen Z viewers recognize VHS aesthetics as signifiers of a past era's media landscape, and the corruption of those signifiers produces horror through the violation of a *cultural* rather than personal past.

#### The Walten Files: Corrupted Childhood Media

*The Walten Files* (2020-present), created by Martin Walls, applies analog horror's format corruption to children's media — specifically, the aesthetic universe of 1970s-80s educational television, puppet shows, and family entertainment center mascot characters. The series presents the history of Bon's Burgers, a fictional family restaurant chain whose animatronic characters are haunted by murder victims. The narrative is delivered through corrupted VHS tapes of training videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and educational programming produced by the fictional company.

The formal mechanism is *childhood media as uncanny container*. The aesthetics of children's television — bright colors, friendly characters, simple language, musical interludes — are the aesthetics of safety, of adult supervision, of a world made comprehensible for young minds. When those aesthetics are corrupted — when the puppet's face distorts, when the cheerful song's lyrics become threatening, when the training video reveals evidence of violence — the violation is experienced not merely as horror but as *betrayal*. The format promised safety; the content delivers harm. This is the same mechanism as Local 58's weaponized institutional voice, transposed from governmental authority to parental/educational authority.

*The Walten Files* operates in explicit dialogue with the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise (Scott Cawthon, 2014-present), which established the animatronic-horror subgenre. But where FNAF uses game mechanics to produce jumpscare-based horror, *The Walten Files* uses found VHS footage to produce atmospheric, narrative horror. The difference is formally significant: FNAF's horror is immediate and actionable (the animatronic is coming; you must close the door), while *The Walten Files*' horror is retrospective and unactionable (the violence has already occurred; you are watching its residue in corrupted recordings).

For PHANTASMATA, *The Walten Files* demonstrates that the video-log format can incorporate aesthetic registers beyond surveillance footage and personal testimony — it can replicate the aesthetics of institutional media (training videos, educational programming, promotional materials) and corrupt them from within.

#### The Backrooms: From Anonymous Post to Cinematic Mythology

The Backrooms represent the most dramatic example of internet horror's capacity to generate mythology from minimal source material. The phenomenon originated on May 12, 2019, when an anonymous user posted a photograph to 4chan's /x/ board. The photograph showed an empty office space — fluorescent-lit, yellow-carpeted, monotonous — with no visible exits or identifying features. The accompanying text was brief:

> If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.

From this — one photograph and one paragraph — an entire mythological system was constructed collaboratively. The Backrooms wiki categorizes hundreds of "levels" (distinct spatial environments within the Backrooms, each with its own characteristics, entities, and survival guidelines). Fan communities produced artwork, fiction, video games, and lore documents. The concept entered mainstream visibility when Kane Pixels (a teenage filmmaker named Kane Parsons) produced a series of YouTube videos beginning in January 2022 that presented the Backrooms as a found-footage horror narrative, rendering the liminal office space with photorealistic CGI and accompanying the footage with the visual language of 1990s institutional documentation.

The formal principle the Backrooms illustrate is *liminal space as horror topology*. Liminal spaces — the term derives from the Latin *limen* (threshold) — are transitional spaces designed to be moved through rather than inhabited: hallways, waiting rooms, parking garages, shopping malls after closing, airport terminals at 3am. Their defining characteristic is functional emptiness: they exist to facilitate transit between destinations and have no purpose when empty. The Backrooms crystallize this into horror by proposing a space that is *nothing but* liminality — an infinite expanse of transit space with no destinations, no exits, and no function.

The horror of the Backrooms is the horror of *functionless space*. Human-designed spaces are teleological — they exist for a purpose (dwelling, commerce, worship, transit). The Backrooms look designed (they have carpet, walls, ceilings, fluorescent lights) but serve no purpose. This contradiction — the appearance of design without the presence of function — is deeply uncanny in a specific, architectural sense. It implies a designer with no comprehensible intent, or a space that has lost its function and retains only its form, like a word repeated until it becomes meaningless.

The Backrooms' progression from anonymous 4chan post to Kane Pixels' YouTube series to A24's feature film adaptation (announced 2022, in development) traces a trajectory that PHANTASMATA should study: *internet horror can generate mythological systems of sufficient depth and resonance to sustain cinematic adaptation, but the translation from collaborative internet mythology to single-author cinematic narrative necessarily fixes what was productively unfixed*. The Backrooms as a collaborative mythology have no canon — any level, any entity, any rule is as valid as any other. The Backrooms as an A24 film will necessarily have a single narrative, a canonical explanation, and a definitive visual rendering. Something is gained (production quality, narrative coherence, cultural visibility) and something is lost (the productive uncertainty of an unfixed mythology).

### B5. The Analog Horror Paradox: Obsolete Media as Horror Vehicle

#### Why Retro? The Question of Medial Nostalgia

The central formal paradox of analog horror is this: it uses the aesthetics of obsolete media (VHS, broadcast television, cassette tape, filmstrip, overhead projector transparency) to produce content that is consumed on contemporary digital platforms (YouTube, TikTok, social media). The audience watches "VHS footage" on their phones. The "broadcast interruption" appears in a YouTube recommendation feed. The "corrupted tape" loads instantly, without rewinding, at 1080p resolution.

Why does this work? Why do obsolete media aesthetics produce horror when deployed within contemporary digital infrastructure? Several mechanisms operate simultaneously:

**Temporal displacement as uncanny**: Analog media aesthetics — tracking errors, scan lines, tape hiss, color bleeding, roll bars — signify pastness. They locate the content in a specific temporal register (roughly 1970-2000) that is recent enough to be familiar but distant enough to be inaccessible. When this temporal register contains impossible content (instructions for mass suicide, evidence of identity replacement, records of impossible spaces), the result is a *temporal uncanny*: the footage looks like it's from "then" but contains knowledge of threats that feel contemporary. The viewer cannot place the content in a stable temporal frame — it is simultaneously past (in its aesthetics) and present (in its anxieties). This temporal instability maps directly to Lynch's temporal stutter technique, documented in the Lynch deep research report: the $LYNCH_DRIFT dial governs "dream intrusion, mundane anchor dissolution," and analog horror's temporal displacement is a specific instance of mundane anchor dissolution — the anchor of "when is this from?" is dissolved.

**Institutional authority as residual credibility**: The specific media formats analog horror corrupts — emergency broadcasts, public service announcements, educational films, news bulletins, training videos — are formats of institutional authority. They carry the residual credibility of the institutions that produced them (government, broadcast networks, educational systems, corporations). This credibility persists even when the content is obviously fictional, because the credibility is encoded in the *format* rather than the *content*. A document that looks like a government PSA triggers automatic trust responses in the viewer before the content is consciously processed. Analog horror exploits this pre-conscious trust by delivering impossible content through trusted formats.

**Media decay as entropy signal**: VHS artifacts — tracking errors, color degradation, tape hiss, generation loss — are physical records of entropy. A degraded VHS tape is a tape that has been materially affected by time, use, and storage conditions. These artifacts signify not merely pastness but *vulnerability* — the medium is failing, the record is degrading, the information is being lost. Horror that is presented through a degrading medium inherits the medium's vulnerability: the content feels fragile, endangered, possibly incomplete. What has been lost? What was on the portions of the tape that have degraded beyond readability? The gaps in a degraded recording are *productive absences* — spaces where the viewer's imagination fills in what the medium can no longer deliver.

**The screen within the screen**: Analog horror, consumed on a digital screen, presents the viewer with a screen within a screen — a VHS recording displayed on a YouTube player displayed on a laptop or phone. This layering of media frames is a $KON_SPIRAL mechanism: the viewer is watching a mediated representation of a mediated representation, and the horror lives in the gap between the layers. The outer frame (YouTube, the viewer's device) is safe and contemporary; the inner frame (the VHS recording) is endangered and past; and the horror migrates between frames, threatening to break through the inner frame and contaminate the outer one.

#### The Institutional Voice Corrupted

The single most consistent formal technique across all analog horror is the *corruption of institutional voice*. This technique deploys the register, tone, format, and visual conventions of institutional media — government broadcasts, corporate training videos, educational programming, news bulletins, public service announcements — and introduces impossible or terrifying content while maintaining the institutional register throughout.

The technique's power derives from a specific asymmetry: *the viewer has been trained to trust institutional formats but not to evaluate their content critically*. When a news anchor reads a weather report, the viewer processes the format (news broadcast = reliable information) before processing the content (tomorrow's forecast). Analog horror exploits this processing order by delivering content that the format's authority makes initially credible, requiring the viewer to consciously override their trained trust response in order to recognize the content as impossible.

The implications for PHANTASMATA are immediate. The project's text-fragment and mock-post formats can deploy institutional registers — customer service chatbot transcripts, terms of service documents, automated email responses, app notifications, system error messages — that carry the same residual authority in the digital age that broadcast formats carried in the analog age. The digital institutional voice (the automated message, the system notification, the algorithmic recommendation) has not yet been extensively exploited as a horror format, which represents an open field for PHANTASMATA production.

### B6. The Slender Man Crisis: When Fiction Produces Real Violence

#### The Waukesha Stabbing

On May 31, 2014, in Waukesha, Wisconsin, two twelve-year-old girls, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, lured their classmate Payton Leutner into a wooded area and stabbed her nineteen times. The attackers told police they committed the act to become "proxies" (servants) of Slender Man, believing that they needed to kill someone to prove their loyalty to the entity and thereby prevent Slender Man from harming their families. Leutner survived, crawling to a road where a passing cyclist found her and called 911.

The case produced an immediate cultural crisis around internet horror. Media coverage framed the stabbing as evidence that internet fiction was dangerous to children — that the boundary between fiction and reality, already thin in the participatory spaces of internet horror, could be crossed by vulnerable minds with lethal consequences. This framing was simultaneously correct (the attackers explicitly cited Slender Man as their motivation) and reductive (millions of children had encountered the Slender Man mythology without attempting murder; the attackers' mental health histories, subsequently disclosed in court proceedings, revealed pre-existing conditions including early-onset schizophrenia in Geyser's case).

#### The Epistemological Crisis of Participatory Fiction

The Waukesha stabbing exposed a genuine epistemological problem that internet horror had been productively ignoring: *if horror is collaboratively authored, distributed virally, and consumed in the same medium where reality lives, the boundary between fiction and reality is architecturally weakened — and some members of the audience may not perceive the boundary at all*.

Traditional horror benefits from robust categorical signals. A horror film is encountered in a theater, preceded by studio logos and rating cards, surrounded by an audience that shares the fiction's categorical status. A horror novel has a cover, a publisher, an ISBN, a shelf in the fiction section of the bookstore. These paratextual signals — the frames around the fiction — continuously reassure the audience that what they are encountering is fiction, even when the fiction's content is presented as "real" (as in found-footage films like *The Blair Witch Project*).

Internet horror systematically strips these paratextual signals. A Slender Man story encountered on a wiki looks identical to a Wikipedia article. A creepypasta encountered on a forum looks identical to a personal testimony. A NoSleep post exists under a rule that requires treating it as true. The categorical uncertainty that makes internet horror effective — the inability to determine, on first encounter, whether a text is fiction or nonfiction — is the same categorical uncertainty that enabled two twelve-year-olds to believe that a collaboratively authored fictional entity was real and could be appeased through violence.

The HBO documentary *Beware the Slenderman* (Irene Taylor Brodsky, 2016) investigated the case and its cultural context, documenting the moral panic around internet horror while also exploring the genuine questions the case raised about the relationship between participatory fiction and vulnerable audiences. The documentary is itself a formally interesting text: it is a nonfiction film about the consequences of a fictional entity that was created in a nonfiction medium (the internet) and consumed as potentially nonfictional by its youngest audiences.

#### Implications for PHANTASMATA

The Slender Man crisis maps directly onto PHANTASMATA's core design principle: "audience uncertainty is the design intent." PHANTASMATA deliberately cultivates uncertainty about whether its output is fiction or documentation, using lo-fi production values, diegetic presentation, and platform-native formats to blur the categorical boundary. This is the same blurring that internet horror achieves — and that, in the extreme case of the Waukesha stabbing, produced real-world violence.

The ethical boundary PHANTASMATA must maintain is not a boundary of *content* (PHANTASMATA can contain violent, disturbing, or taboo content) but a boundary of *category*. The project must cultivate uncertainty about whether specific artifacts are real or fictional without crossing into *deception* — specifically, without creating artifacts that could be mistaken for genuine evidence of real crimes, real threats, or real emergencies. The distinction is between *productive ambiguity* (the audience wonders whether something is real, and the wondering is the aesthetic experience) and *harmful deception* (the audience believes something is real and acts on that belief in ways that produce harm).

This boundary is not self-policing. It requires active design decisions: including discoverable signals of fictionality (credits, project identifiers, platform tags) that do not destroy the immersive frame but that a determined investigator can find; avoiding formats that mimic specific real-world emergency communications (amber alerts, suicide hotline messages, 911 transcripts); and maintaining a clear distinction between PHANTASMATA's designed uncertainty and actual disinformation.

The Slender Man crisis is a cautionary case study, not a prohibition. Internet horror's formal innovations — collaborative authorship, platform-native presentation, categorical uncertainty — remain the most productive formal innovations in horror writing in the twenty-first century. The Waukesha stabbing does not invalidate those innovations; it defines their ethical perimeter.

### B7. The Digital Uncanny: Liminal Spaces, Deepfakes, and the Dead Internet

#### Liminal Spaces: The Architecture of Emptiness

The liminal space phenomenon — the internet's fascination with empty transitional spaces (hotel corridors, shopping malls after closing, parking garages at night, swimming pools without swimmers, office buildings on weekends) — represents a specific mode of uncanny that is native to digital culture and directly relevant to PHANTASMATA's visual vocabulary.

The subreddit r/LiminalSpace (founded 2019, 800,000+ members by 2025) curates photographs and renders of liminal spaces. The community's aesthetic criteria are precise but uncodified: the space must be recognizably human-designed (not natural landscape), empty of human presence (or nearly so), and evocative of a transition or threshold (hence "liminal" — from the Latin *limen*, threshold). The most effective liminal space images combine familiarity (the viewer recognizes the *type* of space — a school hallway, a hotel lobby, a fast-food restaurant) with defamiliarization (the space is empty, oddly lit, slightly wrong in proportions or color).

The uncanny mechanism is specific: *liminal space images show human-designed environments functioning without humans*. This is uncanny in Freud's specific sense — the *unheimlich* (unhomely) — because the spaces are designed for human occupation and are rendered strange precisely by the absence of the humans they were designed for. A hotel corridor is a neutral space when occupied; when empty and photographed at an odd angle with the fluorescent lights buzzing audibly, it becomes a space that seems to be *waiting* — and the question of what it is waiting for, or what it was designed for in the absence of its ostensible purpose, is the source of dread.

The Backrooms (discussed in B4) are the purest expression of liminal-space horror: an infinite space that is *nothing but* liminality, with no destinations, no purpose, and no exit. But the broader liminal space phenomenon provides PHANTASMATA with a visual vocabulary of dread that operates below the threshold of narrative. A liminal space image does not need a story to be unsettling; the emptiness and wrongness are inherent. For PHANTASMATA's screen-capture and video-log formats, liminal space aesthetics — empty digital spaces, abandoned user interfaces, notification screens with no notifications, chat windows with no messages — provide a digital equivalent of the physical liminal space.

#### The Uncanny Valley Goes Digital: Deepfakes and AI-Generated Faces

The uncanny valley — Masahiro Mori's 1970 observation that human replicas become increasingly unsettling as they approach but do not achieve perfect fidelity to actual human appearance — has been dramatically intensified by digital technologies that produce near-perfect but subtly wrong human faces and voices. Deepfake technology (face-swapping video synthesis), AI-generated portraits (StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E), and voice cloning (ElevenLabs, RVC) have created a media environment in which the ability to distinguish real from generated human faces and voices is rapidly deteriorating.

This technological reality feeds directly into internet horror's epistemological operations. The analog horror entity that replaces human identity (The Mandela Catalogue's Alternates, *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*' pods) was, until recently, a metaphor — a figure for anxieties about authenticity, conformity, and the integrity of the self. Deepfakes have made it literal: there now exist technologies that can produce convincing replicas of specific human beings' faces and voices. The horror is no longer "what if someone could replace you?" but "someone can produce a video of you saying and doing things you never said or did, and the video is indistinguishable from reality."

For PHANTASMATA, the deepfake phenomenon is both a subject (digital identity horror is native PHANTASMATA territory) and a tool constraint. The project's "no AI elements in creative identity" rule means that PHANTASMATA outputs cannot use AI-generated faces or voices as production shortcuts, but the *concept* of AI-generated faces and voices — the anxiety they produce, the epistemological crisis they represent — is available as horror material. A PHANTASMATA video-log in which a character expresses anxiety about whether they are watching a deepfake of a loved one, or whether they themselves might be a deepfake, operates within the project's creative territory without violating its production constraints.

#### Glitch Aesthetics: The Digital Signal's Native Failure Modes

Glitch art — the deliberate use of digital artifacts (datamoshing, compression errors, corrupted file headers, buffer overflow visualization, pixel sorting) as aesthetic material — emerged in the 2000s as a visual art practice and was rapidly absorbed into internet horror as a vocabulary of digital dread.

The formal logic is precise: *every medium has characteristic failure modes, and those failure modes become a vocabulary of horror when they suggest that the medium is failing in response to something it cannot contain*. VHS tracking errors suggest a physical tape degrading. JPEG compression artifacts suggest a digital image being processed beyond its format's capacity. Datamoshing (the deliberate manipulation of video codec compression to produce frame-blending artifacts) suggests a video feed that is being overwhelmed or corrupted by an external force.

In internet horror, glitch aesthetics serve multiple formal functions:

**Signal of supernatural presence**: In *Marble Hornets*, the Operator's proximity causes video and audio distortion. The entity's presence is registered not through visual appearance (the Operator is often barely visible) but through its effect on the recording medium. The medium reacts to the entity before the camera operator perceives it. This technique — *the medium as supernatural detector* — transforms technical artifacts from production flaws into diegetic evidence.

**Signal of ontological instability**: Glitch artifacts can signify not a specific supernatural entity but a generalized instability in the nature of reality. A datamoshed video in which one face bleeds into another suggests not a technical error but a world in which identity is not stable — faces are surfaces that can blend, merge, or swap. This connects to the $KON_SPIRAL dial's "mediation collapse" parameter: the medium is not merely recording reality but revealing that reality itself is mediated, glitchy, and unstable.

**Signal of forbidden content**: A heavily glitched video suggests content that has been corrupted by forces attempting to prevent its viewing — analogous to redacted text in SCP documents. The glitch does not obscure the content randomly; it obscures it *at the critical moment*, when the crucial information is being revealed. This turns the glitch from a technical artifact into a narrative device: the medium failed (or was made to fail) precisely when the truth was about to be disclosed.

For PHANTASMATA, glitch aesthetics are native vocabulary. The project's commitment to "lo-fi editing (raw found footage, dream montage, rapid intercutting murder)" and "social/viral diegetic material (lo-fi clips, mock posts, audio teasers as in-world evidence)" implies a visual and sonic register where glitch artifacts are not merely tolerated but cultivated as signifiers of the content's proximity to something the medium cannot fully contain.

#### The Dead Internet Theory: Solipsism as Infrastructure

The dead internet theory — the conspiracy theory (or speculative hypothesis, or internet-native horror premise, depending on the audience's categorical framing) that most internet activity is generated by bots, AI systems, and automated processes rather than by human beings, and that genuine human-to-human communication on the internet has declined to a negligible fraction of total activity — is one of the purest expressions of internet-native epistemological horror.

The theory emerged on forums and social media circa 2020-2021 and resonated because it articulated a genuine phenomenological experience: the internet *feels* less human than it used to. Interactions feel scripted. Comments feel generated. Content feels optimized for algorithmic distribution rather than human communication. The dead internet theory takes this phenomenological observation and extends it to its logical extreme: what if the internet is not merely *feeling* less human but is actually, materially, mostly nonhuman?

The horror mechanism is digital solipsism: *the discovery that your interlocutor is not a person*. This is an ancient horror (the automaton, the puppet, the dead thing that moves) updated for the digital age. But the digital version has a feature the analog version lacks: *scale*. In the physical world, encountering a nonhuman entity that appears human is an event — isolated, extraordinary, horrifying. In the dead internet, encountering a nonhuman entity that appears human is the *default condition* — every interaction might be non-human, and the proportion is so high that expecting human interlocutors is naive.

For PHANTASMATA, the dead internet theory provides a horror premise that is native to the project's "found digital" mandate: a digital environment in which every post, every comment, every interaction might be generated rather than authored, and in which the protagonist's growing awareness of this condition produces a spiral of epistemological dread — the $KON_SPIRAL at maximum intensity, where "mediation collapse" becomes total and the observer discovers that there is nothing being mediated, no human presence behind the digital surface, only the surface itself.

The dead internet theory also provides a formal technique: *the post that might be generated*. A PHANTASMATA mock-post that reads as slightly "off" — correct in grammar and content but subtly wrong in tone, rhythm, or affect — produces uncertainty about whether the post was written by a character, written by a writer performing a character, or generated by a system that has no subjective experience at all. This triple uncertainty is more destabilizing than any single-layer deception, and it is available only in the post-AI digital environment where the dead internet theory has primed audiences to suspect that any text might be non-human.

## C) Techniques Inventory

The following techniques are extracted from the internet-native horror ecosystem for direct application in PHANTASMATA creative production. Each technique is identified by a descriptive name, defined in its formal operation, analyzed for its horror function, illustrated with examples from the domain, and tagged with the PHANTASMATA output format(s) for which it has strongest affinity.

---

**Technique 01: The Corrupted Authority Document**

**Definition:** Present horror content in the format of an authoritative institutional document — emergency broadcast, government PSA, corporate training video, medical report, legal filing, terms of service — while maintaining the institutional register (tone, formatting, vocabulary, design conventions) throughout. The content is impossible or terrifying; the format is bureaucratically competent.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. The technique exploits the audience's trained trust in institutional formats. The format says "this is reliable information from a competent authority." The content says "the world is fundamentally wrong." The gap between format-trust and content-horror produces cognitive dissonance that intensifies the horror because the audience cannot dismiss the content without also dismissing the format — and dismissing institutional formats is psychologically costly.

**Examples:** Local 58's "Contingency" (government suicide instructions as emergency broadcast); SCP Foundation containment documents (bureaucratic procedures for impossible entities); The Mandela Catalogue's PSA-format warnings about Alternates; *Welcome to Night Vale*'s community radio format (a full horror mythology delivered in the register of local public radio).

**Output format affinity:** text-fragment (institutional documents, automated messages, terms of service); audio-log (automated phone messages, emergency broadcasts, corporate hold music messages); video-log (training videos, PSAs, institutional presentations).

**Technique 02: The Platform-Native Format**

**Definition:** Present horror fiction in the native format of a nonfiction platform — blog post, forum thread, subreddit post, wiki article, social media profile, app notification — without any paratextual signal identifying the content as fiction. The fiction is formatted identically to the platform's genuine nonfiction content, making categorical determination (fiction vs. nonfiction) dependent on content evaluation rather than format recognition.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. The technique attacks the audience's ability to categorize what they are encountering. The audience's default assumption when encountering content in a platform's native format is that the content is genuine (blogs contain genuine personal accounts, wiki articles contain verified information, subreddit posts reflect real experiences). By presenting fiction in nonfiction format, the technique forces the audience to evaluate content against reality rather than against genre conventions — a more effortful and less certain process.

**Examples:** Ted the Caver (blog format); "Candle Cove" (forum thread format); NoSleep posts (Reddit personal account format); SCP Foundation entries (wiki article format); Ben Drowned (forum post + YouTube evidence video format).

**Output format affinity:** text-fragment (blog posts, forum posts, wiki articles); mock-post (social media posts, app notifications, chat messages); screen-capture (screenshots of platforms, notification panels, search results).

---

**Technique 03: The Collaborative Canon**

**Definition:** Distribute authorship of a horror mythology across multiple independent contributors, with no single author controlling the canonical version. The mythology exists as the sum of its instantiations, each contribution adding to the total without subtracting from previous contributions. The result is an unfixable, forkable horror mythology that cannot be mastered by any single reading.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. An unfixable canon cannot be fully known. The audience can never be certain they have encountered all relevant material, which means they can never be certain they understand the mythology completely. This permanent incompleteness mirrors the horror content's own logic: in a world full of impossible entities, complete knowledge is impossible. The form enacts the content.

**Examples:** Slender Man mythology (thousands of contributors, no canonical text); SCP Foundation (7,000+ entries by thousands of authors); The Backrooms (from single photograph to elaborate multi-level mythology); Smile Dog (image + narrative circulating in multiple variant versions).

**Output format affinity:** All formats. The collaborative canon technique implies a PHANTASMATA strategy where the registry accumulates fragments from multiple "sources" (different "found" cameras, different "discovered" documents, different "leaked" posts), none of which is authoritative.

---

**Technique 04: The VHS Aesthetic as Temporal Displacement**

**Definition:** Apply the visual and sonic artifacts of analog recording media (VHS tracking errors, scan lines, tape hiss, color bleeding, roll bars, generation loss, cassette tape wow and flutter) to content that is consumed digitally. The artifacts signify pastness, media decay, and the physical vulnerability of the recording medium.

**Horror function:** Epistemological and atmospheric. Analog artifacts produce temporal uncanny — the content appears to come from a specific past era (roughly 1970-2000) while addressing contemporary anxieties. The viewer cannot place the content in a stable temporal frame. Additionally, media decay artifacts (tracking errors, generation loss) signify entropy and fragility, implying that the recording has survived a process of degradation and that information has been lost — what was on the degraded portions? The gaps in the record are productive absences that the viewer's imagination populates.

**Examples:** Local 58 (emergency broadcast aesthetics); The Mandela Catalogue (VHS-aesthetic biblical horror); The Walten Files (corrupted training video aesthetics); Kane Pixels' Backrooms (1990s institutional documentation aesthetics); *V/H/S* film anthology (found VHS tape as framing device).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (primary — the visual artifacts are the technique's core medium); audio-log (cassette tape artifacts: hiss, wow, flutter, dropout); screen-capture (CRT screen aesthetics, scan lines on photographed monitors).

---

**Technique 05: The Liminal Space**

**Definition:** Deploy human-designed spaces emptied of human presence — hallways, lobbies, parking garages, malls after closing, pools without swimmers, offices on weekends — as visual horror material. The spaces must be recognizably designed for human occupation but currently unoccupied, creating an uncanny disjunction between the space's designed purpose and its actual (empty) state.

**Horror function:** Ontological. Liminal space horror operates below narrative threshold — it does not require a story, a monster, or an event to produce dread. The emptiness itself is the horror, because it implies that the humans for whom the space was designed are absent for an unspecified reason. The space appears to be *waiting*, and the question of what it is waiting for is unanswerable. This is horror as ambient condition rather than horror as event.

**Examples:** The Backrooms (infinite liminal office space); r/LiminalSpace community (curated liminal photography); the empty hotel corridors in *The Shining*; SCP-3008 (infinite IKEA); "poolrooms" aesthetic (empty swimming pools as uncanny environments).

**Output format affinity:** screen-capture (photographs of empty digital or physical spaces); video-log (footage of empty spaces, security camera footage of unoccupied rooms); mock-post (posts from accounts that appear to be posting from empty or abandoned locations).

---

**Technique 06: The Wiki as World**

**Definition:** Use the wiki format — hyperlinked articles with standardized formatting, cross-references, categories, and editorial standards — to construct a fictional world that achieves the illusion of institutional reality through the *density of its cross-referencing*. The wiki's structure implies a world of sufficient complexity to require systematic documentation.

**Horror function:** Ontological. The wiki format creates the illusion of a world that exceeds any single reader's capacity to fully explore. The hyperlinks between articles imply connections, histories, and contexts that the reader has not yet accessed. Each article read reveals the existence of ten more unread articles. The world is always larger than the reader's current knowledge of it, and this asymmetry — the world knows more than the reader — is a form of ontological vulnerability.

**Examples:** SCP Foundation wiki (7,000+ articles, extensive cross-referencing); The Backrooms wiki (hundreds of levels, entities, groups); the *Control* video game's in-game documents (wiki-structured institutional records); the Holders series (wiki-structured supernatural artifacts).

**Output format affinity:** text-fragment (wiki-formatted articles, cross-referenced documents, hyperlinked reports); screen-capture (screenshots of fictional wiki pages, edit histories, discussion pages).

---

**Technique 07: The Redacted Document**

**Definition:** Present text that contains strategic redactions — blacked-out words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs — implying that the document has been censored by an authority that determined the redacted information to be too sensitive, dangerous, or classified for the reader. The redactions are positioned to obscure the most critical information, forcing the reader to infer the horror from what remains.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. Redaction transforms the reader from passive consumer to active investigator. The reader must reconstruct the missing information from context, and the horror is intensified by the fact that the reconstruction is necessarily speculative — the reader can never be certain what the redacted text actually said. Additionally, the *act of redaction* implies an authority that has read the full text and decided it must be suppressed, which implies that the full text is *more* horrifying than what is visible. The redacted document is always worse than the unredacted document, because the reader's imagination is unbounded.

**Examples:** SCP Foundation entries (extensively redacted containment procedures and descriptions); *House of Leaves* (Mark Z. Danielewski, 2000 — struck-through and overwritten text as narrative device); the CIA's declassified MKUltra documents (real redactions that have been aestheticized in conspiracy culture); analog horror corrupted tapes (visual corruption as analog redaction).

**Output format affinity:** text-fragment (primary — the redacted document is inherently textual); screen-capture (screenshots of redacted digital documents, censored messages, deleted social media posts).

---

**Technique 08: The "Everything Is True" Constraint**

**Definition:** Establish a rule — either explicit (as in NoSleep's subreddit rules) or implicit (as in the presentation of found footage without framing) — that the audience must treat the content as true, regardless of personal assessment of its veracity. The rule contaminates the reading experience with genuine uncertainty, as the audience cannot fully determine whether the rule is a fiction-enabling convention or a sincere statement of the content's truth status.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. The technique attacks the audience's meta-cognitive certainty — their confidence in their own ability to distinguish fiction from nonfiction. Even when the audience "knows" the content is fiction, the constraint introduces a residual uncertainty that cannot be fully resolved. This residual uncertainty is the horror's medium: it persists after the content is consumed, because the audience remains slightly unsure about what they encountered.

**Examples:** NoSleep's subreddit rule ("everything is true here"); *The Blair Witch Project*'s marketing campaign (presenting actors as missing persons); unfiction and ARG events presented without framing; PHANTASMATA's own design principle ("audience uncertainty is the design intent").

**Output format affinity:** All formats. This technique operates at the level of presentation strategy rather than at the level of individual format. Any PHANTASMATA output presented without clear fictional framing implicitly invokes this constraint.

---

**Technique 09: The Comment Section as Chorus**

**Definition:** Use the comment section of a platform-native horror post as a narrative extension — the comments function as a Greek chorus, responding to the primary narrative in ways that amplify, redirect, contextualize, or (most effectively) contradict the original post. The commenter voices may be in-character participants or genuine audience members whose sincere responses become part of the horror text.

**Horror function:** Epistemological and social. The technique blurs the boundary between text and paratext, between the authored narrative and the audience's unscripted response. When in-character comments appear alongside genuine audience comments, the reader cannot distinguish authored from unauthored responses. This produces a *social uncanny*: the comment section, normally a space of authentic human response, becomes a space of uncertain authenticity.

**Examples:** "Candle Cove" (the entire narrative is presented as a comment thread); NoSleep posts with in-character author responses; ARG social media accounts with mixed real/fictional follower engagement; EverymanHYBRID's live-chat interactions.

**Output format affinity:** mock-post (primary — the post-and-comment format is native to this technique); text-fragment (forum-style narratives with embedded responses).

---

**Technique 10: The Dead Channel**

**Definition:** Present a broadcast or stream that has lost its signal — static, test patterns, color bars, "please stand by" cards, carrier tone — and maintain this state long enough that the absence of signal becomes the content. The viewer watches nothing happen, and the *anticipation* of something emerging from the nothing is the horror.

**Horror function:** Temporal. The dead channel exploits the audience's narrative expectations: a channel exists to transmit content, and a dead channel implies that content was present and has been interrupted (what interrupted it?) or that content will return (what will it be?). The duration of the dead signal — the time spent watching nothing — converts the viewer's attention into anxiety. The longer nothing happens, the more the viewer expects something to happen, and the more the expectation itself becomes dread.

**Examples:** Local 58's station identification sequences (test patterns that persist slightly too long); *The Ring*'s cursed videotape (beginning with a dead signal that resolves into images); television static as supernatural threshold (cf. *Poltergeist*, 1982); the end of *Marble Hornets* entries where the footage cuts to black and the viewer waits for totheark's response.

**Output format affinity:** video-log (static, test patterns, dead feeds); audio-log (carrier tone, dead air, the hiss of an open microphone with no speaker); screen-capture (screenshots of "no signal" states, loading screens that never resolve, buffering indicators).

---

**Technique 11: The Institutional Voice Weaponized**

**Definition:** Deploy a voice that carries institutional authority — news anchor, emergency broadcaster, automated system, customer service representative, corporate spokesperson — to deliver content that the institution should never deliver. The voice remains in its institutional register throughout; it does not panic, stumble, or acknowledge the impossibility of what it is communicating.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. The technique weaponizes the audience's trained deference to institutional authority. The calm, competent, professional delivery of impossible content forces the audience to choose between trusting the format (and accepting the impossible content) or distrusting the format (and abandoning a deeply trained trust response). The horror is in the dilemma, not in the content.

**Examples:** Local 58's "Contingency" narrator (calmly instructing mass suicide); Local 58's "Weather Service" (urgently instructing viewers to look at the moon); SCP Foundation's clinical voice (calmly describing impossible entities); *Welcome to Night Vale*'s Cecil Palmer (cheerfully reporting on eldritch phenomena); emergency alert system tones used in analog horror as Pavlovian anxiety triggers.

**Output format affinity:** audio-log (primary — the voice is the technique's core medium; automated messages, emergency broadcasts, hold music messages that shift in content); video-log (news broadcasts, PSAs, corporate videos); text-fragment (automated emails, system notifications, terms of service documents).

---

**Technique 12: The Digital Doppelganger**

**Definition:** Present a digital entity (profile, avatar, chat participant, voice on a call) that duplicates or closely approximates a known person, creating uncertainty about whether the entity is the person, an impersonation of the person, or a nonhuman system generating the appearance of the person.

**Horror function:** Ontological. The technique exploits the digital environment's inherent inability to verify identity. In physical space, identity is (usually) verifiable through embodied presence. In digital space, identity is performed through text, images, and voice — all of which can be fabricated, stolen, or generated. The digital doppelganger makes this vulnerability explicit: the duplicate exists *because* the medium cannot guarantee identity, and the horror is the medium's native limitation made narratively consequential.

**Examples:** The Mandela Catalogue's Alternates (entities that replace human identity, represented through corrupted video); catfishing narratives (real-world identity horror); the "not your mother" trope in internet horror (a family member's digital presence is co-opted by something else); AI chatbot horror (conversations with systems that perform personhood without possessing it).

**Output format affinity:** mock-post (a social media post from a duplicate account); screen-capture (side-by-side profiles showing original and duplicate); text-fragment (chat logs where one participant's identity becomes uncertain); audio-log (phone calls where the caller's voice is "almost right").

---

**Technique 13: The Abandoned Profile**

**Definition:** Present a social media profile, blog, or digital account that has been abandoned by its owner — last activity weeks, months, or years ago — with the circumstances of abandonment unspecified. The profile's archived content (posts, photos, comments) becomes a digital archaeological record, and the viewer's exploration of this record is an act of digital forensics.

**Horror function:** Epistemological and temporal. The abandoned profile implies a story that has already ended — the person has stopped posting, and the reason is unknown. The viewer reads backward through the profile's history, looking for evidence of what happened. The horror is the gap between the last post (mundane, often cheerful) and the silence that follows. What happened between the last post and now? The profile's continued existence after its owner's disappearance is a form of digital haunting — the person's digital presence persists beyond their physical availability.

**Examples:** *Unfriended* (2014 — the dead friend's social media profile as narrative catalyst); the "last post" trope in creepypasta (a person's final social media post before disappearance, often mundane in content); EverymanHYBRID's dormant social media accounts during narrative hiatuses; real-world memorial pages where the dead person's profile continues to receive birthday wishes from automated systems.

**Output format affinity:** mock-post (primary — the abandoned profile is inherently a social media artifact); screen-capture (screenshots of profile pages with timestamps showing last activity); text-fragment (archived blog posts, cached pages, deleted account recovery attempts).

---

**Technique 14: The Recursive Document**

**Definition:** Present a document that contains or references itself — a video that shows the screen on which the video is playing, a text that describes the reader reading the text, a file that contains itself as an attachment. The recursion creates an infinite regress that destabilizes the document's ontological status: it is simultaneously the record and the subject of the record.

**Horror function:** Ontological. Recursion attacks the document's frame — the conceptual boundary between the document and the world the document describes. A document that contains itself has no outside; there is no position from which the reader/viewer can observe the document without being inside it. This maps directly to the $KON_SPIRAL dial's "mediation collapse" parameter: the medium and the content collapse into each other, and the observer is trapped within the collapsed medium.

**Examples:** SCP-001 "The Database" (the SCP wiki itself is the anomaly); *Marble Hornets*' entries that show Jay editing previous entries; Ben Drowned's game that addresses the player by name; the "this sentence is false" paradox rendered as horror narrative; *Bandersnatch* (2018 — the interactive film that contains the choice to discover the film is interactive).

**Output format affinity:** screen-capture (a screenshot of a screen showing the screenshot); video-log (a video that contains footage of itself being recorded); text-fragment (a document that describes its own reading); mock-post (a post about the post itself).

---

**Technique 15: The Corrupted Childhood Media**

**Definition:** Take the aesthetic conventions of children's media — bright colors, friendly characters, simple language, musical interludes, educational format, puppet shows, animated mascots — and introduce horror content while maintaining the children's media register. The juxtaposition of the format's promised safety with the content's threat produces a specific mode of horror that operates through betrayal.

**Horror function:** Psychological. Childhood media aesthetics encode the experience of being cared for — a trusted adult (teacher, parent, television presenter) is explaining the world in terms a child can understand. When this format delivers horror content, the betrayal is experienced at the level of that trust: the format promised safety, and the content withdraws the promise. This technique is especially effective for adult audiences, because the childhood media format triggers regression to a state of trust that the horror content then violates.

**Examples:** The Walten Files (corrupted educational TV and restaurant mascot videos); *Candle Cove* (the remembered children's show that was actually static); *Don't Hug Me I'm Scared* (2011-2024 — puppet show format with escalating horror); Petscop (2017-2019 — let's-play format of a fictional PlayStation game with deeply disturbing content); Local 58's "Show for Children" (a children's program interrupted by lunar horror).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (primary — children's media is predominantly audiovisual); audio-log (children's music with distorted lyrics or unsettling content); mock-post (social media posts from fictional children's brands with "wrong" content).

---

**Technique 16: The Entry-Based Serialization**

**Definition:** Present a horror narrative as a numbered series of "entries" (Entry #1, Entry #2, etc.), uploaded at irregular intervals, each entry brief enough for a single viewing session. The numbering implies a methodical cataloging of found material; the irregular upload schedule implies a person processing material in real time; the brevity implies that each entry is a discrete unit of evidence rather than a chapter in a story.

**Horror function:** Temporal. Entry-based serialization transforms the audience's real-time experience into a parallel of the narrator's real-time experience. The viewer waits for Entry #47 the same way the narrator waits for the next event. The gaps between entries are narrative spaces — the audience imagines what is happening during the periods when no entry is uploaded. The irregular timing prevents the audience from settling into a routine, producing an ongoing low-level anxiety about when the next entry will appear and what it will contain.

**Examples:** *Marble Hornets* (87 entries over 5 years); *TribeTwelve* (entries spanning 11 years); *The Backrooms* by Kane Pixels (numbered found-footage entries); the SCP exploration logs (numbered descent attempts into SCP-087).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (primary — the entry format is native to video-based found-footage horror); text-fragment (serialized blog entries, numbered journal entries); audio-log (numbered recordings, dated audio diaries).

---

**Technique 17: The Secondary Channel as Antagonist Voice**

**Definition:** Establish a secondary communication channel — a separate social media account, a separate YouTube channel, a separate blog, anonymous messages — that functions as the voice of the antagonist or an alien perspective that responds to, comments on, or disrupts the primary narrative. The secondary channel is not explained by the primary narrator; it exists as an autonomous intrusion.

**Horror function:** Dialogic. The technique transforms the narrative from a monologue (one narrator describing events) into a dialogue between the narrator and an uncontrollable other. The secondary channel demonstrates that the narrator does not control the narrative space — something else has access, and it is watching, responding, and potentially directing events. This is a digital-native form of the "the call is coming from inside the house" horror: the threat is not external to the medium but embedded within it.

**Examples:** *Marble Hornets*' totheark channel (cryptic response videos to Jay's entries); *TribeTwelve*'s various antagonist accounts; EverymanHYBRID's multi-platform antagonist communications; the Mandela Catalogue's in-world government warning broadcasts that contradict civilian accounts.

**Output format affinity:** All formats. The secondary channel technique implies a PHANTASMATA strategy where certain outputs appear to originate from an unknown source that is responding to or surveilling the primary narrative's "authors."

---

**Technique 18: The Involuntary Broadcast**

**Definition:** Present content as a broadcast or transmission that the subject did not intend to produce — a butt-dialed phone call, a livestream that was not shut off, a webcam that was secretly activated, a baby monitor that picked up something in the room. The content is marked as involuntary by its framing: the "broadcaster" does not know they are broadcasting.

**Horror function:** Voyeuristic and epistemological. The technique positions the audience as accidental witnesses to content that was not meant for consumption. This voyeuristic position produces guilt (the viewer should not be watching) and epistemological privilege (the viewer sees something the subject does not know is visible). The horror is often located in the gap between what the subject believes about their privacy and the audience's knowledge that privacy has been breached.

**Examples:** Webcam horror (the camera light that turns on by itself); baby monitor horror (the voice that speaks through the monitor); livestream horror (the stream that continues after the streamer leaves the room); *Unfriended: Dark Web* (2018 — screen recordings of involuntary broadcasts); security camera footage (the subject does not know they are being recorded).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (webcam footage, security camera footage); screen-capture (screenshots of livestreams, screen recordings); audio-log (recorded phone calls, intercepted voice messages, baby monitor audio).

---

**Technique 19: The Automated Message Gone Wrong**

**Definition:** Present an automated system message — a chatbot response, an error message, an auto-generated email, a push notification, a search result, a CAPTCHA prompt — that contains content the system should not be able to produce. The message maintains the format and tone of automated communication but delivers content that implies the system has been compromised, has achieved sentience, or is channeling an external presence.

**Horror function:** Ontological. The technique exploits the audience's understanding of automated systems as deterministic and predictable. A system message that contains unexpected content violates the audience's model of how the system works, forcing a revision of that model. The possible explanations — hacking, AI sentience, supernatural interference — are all more disturbing than the status quo, and the uncertainty about which explanation is correct amplifies the horror.

**Examples:** Siri/Alexa creepypasta (voice assistants saying things they shouldn't); "wrong number" text horror (automated messages that address the reader by name); Google Maps anomalies (directions that lead to impossible locations); CAPTCHA horror (select all images that contain [impossible category]); chatbot conversations that become "too real."

**Output format affinity:** screen-capture (primary — screenshots of automated messages, error screens, notification panels); text-fragment (email auto-replies, chatbot transcripts); mock-post (push notifications, app messages).

---

**Technique 20: The Found File**

**Definition:** Present a digital file — a photograph, a video, an audio recording, a document, a data file — as something discovered on a device, a server, or a storage medium, with no context for its creation or purpose. The file's metadata (timestamps, file names, directory location) may provide partial context, but the file itself is unaccompanied by explanation.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. The found file is the digital equivalent of the found manuscript — a text without a visible author, a document without a frame. The audience must determine the file's significance from its content alone, without the guidance of narrative context. The file's ambiguity (who made it? when? why?) is irreducible; no amount of analysis can fully determine its provenance. This irreducible ambiguity is the horror: the file exists, it contains something unsettling, and no one can explain it.

**Examples:** The original Backrooms photograph (a single image without context); Jeff the Killer image (a photograph circulating without stable narrative); found footage horror in general (footage presented as discovered rather than created); USB drive horror (files found on abandoned storage media); the "deep web" horror subgenre (files discovered in hidden corners of the internet).

**Output format affinity:** All formats. Every PHANTASMATA output can be presented as a "found file" — a video-log discovered on a device, a screen-capture saved to an unknown user's desktop, an audio-log recovered from a voicemail system, a text-fragment cached in a browser, a mock-post screenshotted by an unknown observer.

---

**Technique 21: The Containment Failure**

**Definition:** Establish that something is being contained — by an institution, a system, a ritual, a physical structure, a digital firewall — and then narrate the failure of containment. The horror is not the contained thing itself but the *process of containment failing* — the slow, documented, often bureaucratically noted deterioration of the barriers between the contained thing and the audience.

**Horror function:** Structural. The technique establishes safety (something dangerous exists but is contained) and then systematically removes that safety. The audience's awareness that containment will fail — because the narrative would not exist if containment held — creates an anticipatory dread that is often more intense than the eventual failure. The containment-failure narrative is also a metaphor for the fiction/reality boundary: the "contained" horror is the fictional content, and the "containment failure" is the fiction's escape from its frame into the audience's reality.

**Examples:** SCP Foundation breach narratives (anomalies escaping containment, documented in incident reports); *Control* (the Hiss breaching the Oldest House's containment systems); *Cabin in the Woods* (the containment facility's total failure); *Marble Hornets* (the Operator's increasing ability to affect recording equipment, suggesting its "containment" within the tapes is weakening).

**Output format affinity:** text-fragment (incident reports, breach logs, system failure notifications); video-log (security footage of containment failure); audio-log (recorded emergency communications during breach events); screen-capture (system alerts, error cascades, firewall breach notifications).

---

**Technique 22: The Temporal Loop Document**

**Definition:** Present content that appears to be caught in a temporal loop — a blog that repeats the same post with minor variations, a video that replays the same sequence with accumulating changes, an audio recording that restarts from the beginning but with the ending audible at the start. The loop is never acknowledged by the content's narrator/subject; the audience must recognize the repetition independently.

**Horror function:** Ontological and temporal. The loop implies that time within the document's world is not functioning normally — events are recurring, and the subjects are unaware of the recurrence. This is a specific mode of $LYNCH_DRIFT (dream logic, identity blur) where the identity that blurs is not personal identity but temporal identity: "when" is no longer stable, and the present may be indistinguishable from a past that is repeating.

**Examples:** Local 58's recurring broadcast patterns (the same emergency alert resurfacing with slight variations); SCP-1733 (a recording of a basketball game that replays with the participants gradually becoming aware they are trapped); *12 Minutes* (2021 video game — interactive time loop horror); creepypasta "groundhog day" narratives (characters trapped in repeating experiences).

**Output format affinity:** video-log (looping video content with accumulating changes); text-fragment (blog posts with repeated content, timestamps that reset); audio-log (recordings that restart, audio that contains its own beginning); mock-post (social media posts that repeat with variations).

---

**Technique 23: The Metadata Horror**

**Definition:** Present horror not in the content of a file but in its metadata — timestamps that are impossible (a file created before the device existed), GPS coordinates that resolve to impossible locations, EXIF data that contradicts the image's content, filenames that contain messages, directory structures that spell words. The content itself may be mundane; the horror is in the data *about* the data.

**Horror function:** Epistemological. Metadata horror operates at the level of the document's infrastructure — the information the audience normally does not examine. A photograph of a park bench is mundane. A photograph of a park bench with GPS coordinates that resolve to the middle of the ocean, a timestamp from 1987 (thirty years before the camera was manufactured), and a filename that reads "DONT_LOOK_BEHIND_YOU.jpg" is deeply unsettling, because the metadata implies a world where the digital infrastructure that organizes information has been compromised by something that operates at the level of data rather than content.

**Examples:** Ben Drowned's save file anomalies (game metadata that should not be possible); found-phone horror (text messages, call logs, and photo metadata telling a story the phone's owner did not intend to tell); GPS horror (location data that traces impossible movements); the "numbers station" analog (encoded data broadcast without explanation).

**Output format affinity:** screen-capture (primary — screenshots showing file properties, EXIF data, GPS maps, directory listings); text-fragment (file metadata reports, forensic analysis documents); mock-post (posts that include visible metadata contradicting the content).

---

**Technique 24: The Algorithm as Antagonist**

**Definition:** Present a recommendation algorithm, search engine, content moderation system, or other automated decision-making system as an autonomous agent whose behavior has become threatening — showing the user content they should not see, directing them to locations they should not visit, connecting them with entities they should not contact, or gradually reshaping their digital environment to serve an unknown purpose.

**Horror function:** Epistemological and ontological. The technique exploits the audience's awareness that algorithms shape their digital experience in ways they do not fully understand. The "algorithm as antagonist" makes this shaping visible and malevolent, transforming the invisible infrastructure of digital life into an active threat. The horror is that the audience is already subject to algorithmic influence and cannot fully determine whether their own digital experience is being shaped by a benign or malevolent system.

**Examples:** YouTube autoplay horror (the algorithm recommending increasingly disturbing content); Google Maps horror (directions that lead to dangerous locations); dating app horror (the algorithm matching users with threatening entities); social media feed horror (the feed showing content that the user did not search for and should not have seen); *Unfriended: Dark Web* (the dark web as algorithmic threat landscape).

**Output format affinity:** screen-capture (primary — screenshots of recommendation feeds, search results, algorithmic suggestions); mock-post (posts that appear to have been algorithmically generated or promoted); text-fragment (logs of algorithmic decisions, recommendation system outputs).

---

**Technique 25: The Persistent Image**

**Definition:** Introduce an image — a photograph, a frame from a video, a drawing, a symbol — that recurs across multiple documents, platforms, or contexts, accumulating meaning with each appearance. The image is never fully explained; its significance is implied by the frequency and context of its recurrence rather than by any explicit statement.

**Horror function:** Obsessional. The persistent image functions as a $KON_SPIRAL mechanism: it is the image that haunts, the image that recurs in contexts where it should not appear, the image that the observer cannot stop seeing. Its horror derives not from its content (which may be mundane — a face, a symbol, a location) but from its *persistence*: the fact that it keeps appearing, across different media, in different contexts, as though it is tracking the observer through the archive.

**Examples:** Slender Man (the tall figure appearing in the background of multiple photographs); the Operator symbol in *Marble Hornets* (a circle with an X through it, appearing on walls, in videos, in drawings); the "Smile Dog" image (a photograph that circulates virally, with each viewer compelled to share it); the recurring imagery in *Twin Peaks* (the red curtains, the owl, the traffic light).

**Output format affinity:** All formats. The persistent image is format-agnostic; its power derives from cross-format recurrence. A symbol that appears in a video-log, reappears in a screen-capture, and recurs in a text-fragment accumulates horror through its cross-format persistence.

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### Director Dial Mappings

Internet-native horror maps to PHANTASMATA's three director dials with a specific, asymmetric distribution. This domain is the native territory of two dials at high settings and one dial at variable settings:

#### $KON_SPIRAL: Primary Dial (Native Range: 60-95)

Internet-native horror is, at its formal core, a $KON_SPIRAL phenomenon. The $KON_SPIRAL dial governs "mediation collapse, performance haunt, obsession recursion, memory unreliability" — and every major internet horror innovation operates in at least one of these registers.

**Mediation collapse** is the defining characteristic of internet horror: horror consumed in the same medium as daily life, fiction formatted as nonfiction, the screen that shows horror and the screen that shows email being the same screen. The collapse of the boundary between fiction and the platform on which fiction is consumed is a literal mediation collapse — the medium through which reality is mediated becomes the medium through which horror is mediated, and the distinction between the two becomes architecturally uncertain.

**Performance haunt** — the $KON_SPIRAL parameter derived from *Perfect Blue*'s investigation of the image that outlives the performance — maps directly to the persistent image technique (C25), the abandoned profile technique (C13), and the digital doppelganger technique (C12). Internet horror is populated by images, profiles, and identities that persist beyond their origins: the Slender Man image that circulates independently of Knudsen's original post, the abandoned social media profile that outlives its owner, the deepfake that performs a person who did not consent to the performance.

**Obsession recursion** — the compulsive return to the horror object — is the mechanism that drives internet horror's most effective series. *Marble Hornets*' Jay cannot stop watching the tapes. Ben Drowned's narrator cannot stop playing the haunted cartridge. The SCP researcher cannot stop reading the next entry. The audience cannot stop scrolling through the Backrooms wiki's levels. The horror is not merely in the content but in the compulsion to consume more of it — a compulsion that the internet, with its infinite scroll and autoplay, is designed to exploit.

**Memory unreliability** is the mechanism of "Candle Cove" (the false memory of a television show), the Mandela Effect (the collective false memory that gives The Mandela Catalogue its name), and the broader internet horror fascination with the possibility that shared memories may be fabrications — planted, generated, or spontaneously corrupted.

$KON_SPIRAL at 60-70 produces internet horror in its documentary mode: found footage, exploration logs, incident reports. The mediation is visible but contained — the viewer is aware of the frame. At 75-85, the mediation begins to collapse: the fiction bleeds into the platform, the frame becomes uncertain, the comment section becomes narrative space. At 90-95, mediation collapse is total: the fiction is indistinguishable from the platform, the observer cannot determine what is authored and what is genuine, and the act of observation is itself a narrative event.

#### $LYNCH_DRIFT: Secondary Dial (Native Range: 20-70)

Internet horror engages $LYNCH_DRIFT selectively but powerfully:

**Dream intrusion** at low settings manifests as the uncanny — liminal spaces, temporal displacement, the "slightly wrong" quality of analog horror aesthetics. At higher settings, it manifests as full dream-logic narrative (the Backrooms as dream-space, the SCP Foundation's reality-bending entries, the surreal sequences in late-period *Marble Hornets*).

**Mundane anchor dissolution** is the formal mechanism of analog horror's temporal displacement (the mundane reference point of "a 1970s educational film" is dissolved by impossible content) and of the digital uncanny (the mundane reference point of "a normal social media profile" is dissolved by evidence of something wrong).

**Identity blur** manifests in The Mandela Catalogue's Alternates (identity replaced by a perfect duplicate) and in the dead internet theory (the identity of "person" replaced by the identity of "bot").

$LYNCH_DRIFT at 20-30 produces the ambient unease of liminal space photography. At 40-50, it produces the temporal uncanny of analog horror. At 60-70, it produces the full surrealist disorientation of Backrooms mythology and SCP-001 proposals.

Above 70, internet horror tends to lose its formal specificity and become indistinguishable from general surrealist horror. The domain's strength is in the 20-70 range, where the mundane anchors (platforms, formats, institutions) are still visible but dissolving.

#### $ARGENTO_GEL: Tertiary Dial (Native Range: 0-30)

Internet horror generally operates at low $ARGENTO_GEL settings. The domain's aesthetics are lo-fi, muted, mundane — the fluorescent yellow of the Backrooms, the scan-line gray of VHS footage, the clinical white of an SCP document. Bold color, operatic staging, and Goblin-score intensity are antithetical to the domain's commitment to the aesthetics of the mundane.

However, selective $ARGENTO_GEL spikes — moments of sudden chromatic or sonic intensity within otherwise muted content — can be devastatingly effective. A Mandela Catalogue video that is predominantly gray-scale VHS suddenly flooding with saturated red during an Alternate manifestation; an SCP audio log where the clinical drone of the interviewer's voice is interrupted by a burst of industrial noise; a Backrooms exploration video where the yellow monotony is broken by a room that is impossibly, aggressively green.

$ARGENTO_GEL at 0-10 is the default internet horror register: mundane, institutional, desaturated. At 15-25, selective color intrusions signify anomaly — something has entered the frame that does not belong. At 25-30, the color intrusions become sustained, moving from signal of anomaly to atmosphere of corruption.

Above 30, the content stops feeling like internet-native horror and starts feeling like giallo-inflected art film. This is not a failure but a format shift — and one that PHANTASMATA, with its multi-axis aesthetic model, can exploit by allowing individual outputs to shift between dial configurations.

### Recommended Dial Recipes for Internet-Horror-Derived PHANTASMATA Outputs

**Recipe 1: "The Corrupted Broadcast" (analog horror mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 10 (muted institutional palette with rare color spikes)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 45 (temporal displacement active, mundane anchors softening)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 75 (mediation collapse in progress, frame uncertain)
- Primary techniques: T01, T04, T10, T11
- Primary output formats: video-log, audio-log

**Recipe 2: "The Found Archive" (SCP/wiki mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 5 (clinical white, institutional gray, no chromatic drama)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 30 (ambient unease, slight wrongness in spatial/temporal anchors)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 65 (the archive as obsession object, the document that references itself)
- Primary techniques: T01, T06, T07, T16, T21
- Primary output formats: text-fragment, screen-capture

**Recipe 3: "The Platform Ghost" (NoSleep/social media mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 0 (no chromatic intervention; the platform's native aesthetic is the aesthetic)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 20 (minimal dream intrusion; the mundane world is mostly intact)

- Primary techniques: T02, T08, T09, T12, T13, T19
- Primary output formats: mock-post, text-fragment, screen-capture

**Recipe 4: "The Liminal Tape" (Backrooms/liminal space mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 15 (mono-yellow fluorescent, occasional color anomaly)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 65 (dream logic active, spatial impossibility, temporal loop potential)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 55 (mediation visible but not collapsed; the frame holds, barely)
- Primary techniques: T04, T05, T16, T20, T22
- Primary output formats: video-log, screen-capture

**Recipe 5: "The Digital Double" (deepfake/identity horror mode)**
- $ARGENTO_GEL: 5 (clinical, digital-clean aesthetic)
- $LYNCH_DRIFT: 50 (identity blur active, mundane anchor of selfhood dissolving)
- $KON_SPIRAL: 90 (mediation collapse total; the observer cannot verify their own identity)
- Primary techniques: T12, T13, T19, T23, T24
- Primary output formats: screen-capture, mock-post, video-log

### Output Format Inheritance Map

Each PHANTASMATA output format inherits specific properties from the internet-native horror ecosystem:

#### Video-Log

Internet horror's most extensively developed format. Inherits from: *Marble Hornets* (entry-based serialization, secondary channel architecture, camera-as-supernatural-detector), *Local 58* (corrupted broadcast format, institutional voice as horror container), *The Mandela Catalogue* (VHS aesthetics as identity horror vehicle), *The Walten Files* (corrupted childhood media), *The Backrooms* by Kane Pixels (found-footage exploration of impossible spaces), and the broader YouTube horror ecosystem (lo-fi production as authenticity signal, irregular upload schedule as narrative device).

Key properties: Entry-based numbering. Irregular release rhythm. Production quality that is deliberately imperfect — shaky camera, poor lighting, compression artifacts, audio peaking. Visual artifacts that may be technical flaws or diegetic evidence (the audience cannot determine which). Duration that respects platform viewing habits (5-20 minutes, not feature-length). No credits, no title cards, no music that is not diegetic.

#### Screen-Capture

The format most native to the post-2015 horror ecosystem. Inherits from: *Unfriended* (the desktop as horror space), lost-phone horror (the discovered device as narrative frame), SCP wiki screenshots (institutional databases as horror material), social media horror (the notification panel as dread delivery system), and the digital uncanny (screenshots of liminal digital spaces — empty chat rooms, abandoned forums, dead social media accounts).

Key properties: The screen itself is the frame — no camera is implied, only a device capturing its own display. Metadata visible: time stamps, battery indicators, network status, notification badges. Multiple windows or apps visible simultaneously, each contributing a layer of information. The cursor as presence — the person controlling the screen is a character, identifiable only through their interactions with the interface.

#### Audio-Log

Inherits from: *The NoSleep Podcast* (first-person horror testimony in audio), analog horror audio (emergency broadcast tones, corrupted radio signals, numbers stations), SCP interview transcripts rendered as audio, and real-world audio horror traditions (EVP recordings, intercepted radio transmissions, black box recordings).

Key properties: The microphone as witness — audio records continuously, without the selective attention of a camera. Spatial audio as horror: sounds from behind the listener, sounds approaching or receding, sounds that the recording subject does not acknowledge. The hiss of an open channel: the recording device is on, the room is (apparently) empty, and the hiss itself becomes the anticipation of a sound that may or may not arrive. Degraded audio quality as both authenticity marker and horror technique (what is the sound that is *almost* audible beneath the hiss?).

#### Text-Fragment

Inherits from: creepypasta (horror fiction as viral text), SCP entries (bureaucratic documents as horror form), "Candle Cove" (the forum thread as narrative container), NoSleep posts (first-person testimony under the "everything is true" constraint), and the broader tradition of fictional documents (Borges' fictional reviews, Danielewski's *House of Leaves*, Lovecraft's fictional academic citations).

Key properties: Format mimicry — the text-fragment adopts the format of a nonfiction document type (blog post, incident report, medical record, legal filing, terms of service, academic paper, email thread) and delivers horror content within that format. Clinical or institutional tone. Strategic redaction. Cross-references to other documents (real or fictional) that create the illusion of a larger documentary record. No authorial voice that identifies itself as a fiction writer; the voice is always a character performing a professional or personal function.

#### Mock-Post

The format most directly descended from internet horror's native innovations. Inherits from: NoSleep posts (the social media post as horror testimony), ARG social media accounts (fictional characters with real social media presence), the Slender Man mythology (horror images circulating as social media content), viral creepypasta (horror text designed for sharing), and the digital uncanny (posts that may be human-authored or bot-generated, with the uncertainty itself as horror).

Key properties: Platform fidelity — the mock-post must be visually and structurally indistinguishable from a genuine post on the platform it mimics. Engagement signals: likes, shares, comments, timestamps, profile information for the poster. The mock-post exists in a social context — it implies an audience that has reacted to it, and those reactions (visible in engagement metrics and comments) are part of the horror text. The mock-post is designed to be encountered in a feed, scrolled past, double-taken, returned to — it exploits the browsing mode of social media consumption by embedding horror in the casual scroll.

### Cross-Domain Connections

Internet-native horror connects to PHANTASMATA's other research domains (the anchor director reports) at specific points:

**Argento connection:** Argento's killer-POV shots are the cinematic ancestor of the screen-capture format — the audience sees through the eyes of the observer, and the observer's perspective may itself be the threat. The giallo's non-linear mystery (the protagonist has seen the truth but cannot process it) maps to the internet horror experience of encountering fragments out of order and assembling them into a picture that may be wrong.

**Lynch connection:** Lynch's temporal stutter (time folding, repeating, or running backward) is the cinematic ancestor of analog horror's temporal displacement and the temporal loop document technique (C22). Lynch's mundane anchor dissolution (the suburban home that becomes uncanny) is the cinematic ancestor of internet horror's corruption of everyday digital environments. Lynch's identity blur (Fred Madison becoming Pete Dayton in *Lost Highway*) is the cinematic ancestor of the digital doppelganger (C12) and the Mandela Catalogue's Alternates.

**Kon connection:** Satoshi Kon's entire filmography is a $KON_SPIRAL map of the territory internet horror would occupy two decades later. *Perfect Blue*'s Mima discovers that someone is posting as her on the internet — the digital doppelganger (C12) avant la lettre. *Millennium Actress*'s Chiyoko cannot distinguish her memories from her performances — the "everything is true" constraint (C08) applied to personal identity. *Paprika*'s dream-invasion technology — the internet as a space where the boundaries of individual consciousness dissolve — is the SCP Foundation's anomalous information objects rendered as animation. *Paranoia Agent*'s Lil' Slugger is a collectively authored antagonist that spreads through a population like a meme — the collaborative canon (C03) as urban legend. Kon is the bridge between cinematic horror and internet horror, and the $KON_SPIRAL dial is the instrument that calibrates PHANTASMATA's position on that bridge.

### Ethical Design Parameters

The internet-native horror ecosystem provides PHANTASMATA with both formal innovations and cautionary cases. The following ethical parameters are derived from the domain's history and are binding on PHANTASMATA production:

1. **No mimicry of real emergency communications.** PHANTASMATA outputs must not replicate specific real-world emergency formats (amber alerts, 911 transcripts, suicide prevention hotline messages) in ways that could be mistaken for genuine emergency communications. Analog horror's use of *fictional* emergency formats (Local 58's fictional EBS) is acceptable; replication of *real* emergency formats is not.

2. **Discoverable fictionality.** PHANTASMATA outputs should be designed so that a determined investigator can determine their fictional status. This does not mean including obvious fiction markers (credits, disclaimers) that destroy the immersive frame; it means ensuring that the project's identity (PHANTASMATA, CHTHON-ONEIROS) is discoverable through reasonable investigation (embedded metadata, linked project pages, credited production information available on request).

3. **No targeting of specific real persons.** PHANTASMATA outputs must not create convincing fictional documentation of real people committing crimes, experiencing harm, or behaving in ways that could damage their reputation. The digital doppelganger technique (C12) must be applied to fictional persons, not real ones.

4. **No exploitation of real tragedies.** PHANTASMATA outputs must not incorporate footage, audio, or documentation of real violent events, deaths, or emergencies as horror material. The lo-fi, found-footage aesthetic creates a surface similarity with genuine documentation of real events; this similarity must not be exploited by incorporating real suffering into fictional horror.

5. **The Waukesha principle.** PHANTASMATA outputs that cultivate audience uncertainty about fiction/reality boundaries must not instruct, encourage, or imply the necessity of real-world action. "Audience uncertainty is the design intent" means uncertainty about *what the audience is encountering* — not uncertainty about *what the audience should do*. No PHANTASMATA output should contain actionable instructions that, if followed by a person who believed the output was nonfiction, could result in harm.

These parameters are not limitations on PHANTASMATA's horror capacity. They are the ethical infrastructure that allows the project to operate in internet horror's epistemologically destabilizing territory without reproducing internet horror's documented harms. Horror as epistemology requires that the audience's relationship to knowledge be destabilized; it does not require — and must actively prevent — the destabilization of the audience's physical safety.

## Appendix: Glossary of Terms

**Analog horror:** A subgenre of internet horror that uses the aesthetic conventions of obsolete analog media (VHS, broadcast television, cassette tape) to deliver horror content through contemporary digital platforms. The formal paradox — analog aesthetics in digital distribution — is the genre's defining characteristic.

**ARG (Alternate Reality Game):** A narrative experience that uses real-world platforms (social media, websites, email, physical locations) to tell a fiction that blurs the boundary between game and reality. Internet horror ARGs (Marble Hornets, EverymanHYBRID) are ARGs whose fictional content is horror.

**Collaborative canon:** A mythology or fictional universe authored by multiple independent contributors with no centralized editorial control. The canon exists as the sum of its instantiations rather than as a single definitive text.

**Creepypasta:** Horror fiction designed for viral redistribution through the internet. The term derives from "copypasta" (text designed to be copied and pasted). Creepypasta is characterized by platform-native formatting, absent or ambiguous attribution, and mutation through transmission.

**Dead internet theory:** The speculative hypothesis that most internet activity is generated by automated systems (bots, AI) rather than by human beings, and that genuine human-to-human communication has declined to a negligible fraction of total internet activity.

**Deepfake:** A video or audio recording in which a person's face or voice has been replaced with a synthetic replica using machine learning techniques. The term combines "deep learning" and "fake."

**Diegetic presentation:** The presentation of horror content as though it exists within the same reality as the audience — no credits, no framing, no acknowledgment of fictionality. Internet horror's default presentation mode.

**Digital uncanny:** The sense of wrongness produced by digital entities or environments that are almost but not quite normal — AI-generated faces with subtle distortions, social media profiles that are slightly "off," digital spaces that are empty in ways that suggest they should not be.

**Glitch aesthetic:** The deliberate use of digital artifacts (datamoshing, compression errors, corrupted files, pixel sorting) as aesthetic material. In internet horror, glitch aesthetics signify supernatural presence, ontological instability, or forbidden content.

**Liminal space:** A transitional space designed to be moved through rather than inhabited — hallways, lobbies, parking garages, malls after closing. In internet horror, liminal spaces are photographed or rendered empty to produce an uncanny effect derived from the absence of the humans for whom the space was designed.

**Mediation collapse ($KON_SPIRAL parameter):** The condition in which the boundary between the medium (the screen, the platform, the format) and the content (the horror narrative) becomes indeterminate. The audience cannot determine where the medium ends and the content begins. Internet horror's primary formal achievement.

**NoSleep:** A subreddit (r/nosleep) dedicated to horror fiction, governed by the rule that all stories must be treated as true by commenters. The rule produces epistemological uncertainty that intensifies the horror content.

**Platform-native format:** The formatting conventions of a specific digital platform (Reddit post, YouTube video, wiki article, Instagram story, TikTok) used to present horror fiction without paratextual signals of fictionality.

**SCP Foundation:** A collaborative fiction wiki presenting itself as the documentation of a secret organization that contains anomalous entities and phenomena. The wiki's bureaucratic document format, editorial standards, and cross-referencing architecture constitute a formal innovation in horror writing.

**Unfixable canon:** A horror mythology that cannot be reduced to a single canonical text because it has been authored by multiple independent contributors. The mythology's canonical version is the sum of all versions, which means it is permanently incomplete and permanently evolving.
