## A) Topic Definition and Scope

PHANTASMATA's founding constraint is a six-word manifesto: "horror as epistemology, not genre decoration." This brief is the theoretical ground beneath that manifesto. Every other brief in this series investigates a formal tradition — found footage (Brief 01), internet-native horror (Brief 02), giallo (Brief 03), dream cinema (Brief 04), Asian horror (Brief 06) — and extracts production-ready techniques. This brief operates at a different level. It does not ask *how horror is made* but *why horror works*, *what horror knows*, and *what it means for a creative project to treat horror as a mode of knowing rather than a genre of entertainment*. The other briefs are formal toolkits. This brief is the epistemological warrant for using them.

The investigation consolidates two research streams: the *philosophy of horror* (Burke, Kant, Radcliffe, Freud, Carroll, Kristeva, Thacker — asking what horror is, why it attracts, what it reveals about consciousness) and the *psychology of fear* (Pavlov, Watson, LeDoux, Rozin — asking how fear operates physiologically, how it is conditioned, how horror media exploits the fear system). The philosophical tradition provides concepts: the sublime, the uncanny, the abject, the weird, the eerie. The psychological tradition provides mechanisms: the startle reflex, conditioned fear, excitation transfer, benign masochism, pattern recognition. PHANTASMATA requires both — concepts to know what it is doing, mechanisms to know how to do it.

The consolidation rests on a specific analytical claim: these two traditions converge on the same insight from opposite directions. The philosophers: horror reveals the limits of rational comprehension, the point at which the mind's categories fail. The psychologists: fear activates when the threat-detection system encounters patterns that cannot be assimilated into existing cognitive schemas. Both describe the same event: *the moment when knowing breaks down*. The philosophers call it the sublime, the uncanny, the weird. The psychologists call it the orienting response, the schema violation, the prediction error. PHANTASMATA calls it the operating condition of all its output.

Horror is the affect that accompanies epistemic failure. Not the failure to know a particular fact — that is ignorance, which is remediable. Horror accompanies the failure of the *capacity* to know — the discovery that one's perceptual apparatus, cognitive categories, or communicative infrastructure cannot process what is present. When you see something that should not exist ($ARGENTO_GEL), when you cannot determine who you are ($LYNCH_DRIFT), when you cannot trust the medium through which you receive information ($KON_SPIRAL) — the affect produced is horror, and the horror is not the failure itself but the *recognition* of the failure. The dread is the knowledge that knowing has broken.

This is a technical claim, not a metaphorical one. Horror operates on the knowledge system — targets the mechanisms by which a subject constructs a reliable model of reality and demonstrates their fragility. The monster in Carroll threatens the category system. The sublime in Burke overwhelms the perceptual apparatus. The uncanny in Freud collapses the boundary between the familiar and the alien. In every case, the horror is epistemological.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What is the relationship between fear (biological response) and horror (aesthetic-philosophical category), and why does this distinction matter for a project that produces creative artifacts?
2. How does Burke's theory of the sublime ground PHANTASMATA's treatment of overwhelming perceptual experience?
3. What does Radcliffe's distinction between terror (expanding the mind) and horror (contracting it) mean for PHANTASMATA's calibration of effects?
4. How does Freud's uncanny provide the conceptual architecture for $LYNCH_DRIFT?
5. Why does Carroll's monster-dependent definition of art-horror fail to account for PHANTASMATA's primary influences (Lynch, Kon, Kurosawa), and what alternative definition does this failure demand?
6. How do psychological mechanisms of fear translate into specific production techniques for found-digital formats?
7. What does cosmic horror (Lovecraft, Ligotti, Thacker, Fisher) contribute that earlier traditions do not?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. The Sublime Tradition (1757–1900)

#### Burke: Terror as the Ruling Principle

Edmund Burke's *A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful* (1757) is horror theory's founding document. Its central claim: terror is the strongest passion the mind is capable of feeling — stronger than pleasure, love, or any positive emotion. The passions of self-preservation (pain, danger) are more powerful than the passions of pleasure, because self-preservation is more urgent. The sublime is the aesthetic experience that arises when terror operates at sufficient distance — the source of danger present enough to excite the passion but distant enough not to produce actual harm. Burke calls this "delightful horror": the paradox of a mind excited by what would, if real, produce agony. This is the first articulation of the paradox of horror.

Burke's catalogue of sublime triggers remains operational after three centuries. *Obscurity*: "To make anything very terrible, obscurity seems in general to be necessary. When we know the full extent of any danger... a great deal of the apprehension vanishes." This is the theoretical foundation of the absent antagonist (Blair Witch never shown), audio-priority horror (Brief 01, Technique 9), the principle that the imagined threat exceeds the visible one. *Darkness*: not merely associated with danger but an epistemological threat — it attacks the knowledge system by disabling its primary sensory channel. This maps onto PHANTASMATA's restricted visual fields: night-vision, the screen in the dark room. *Vastness*: the object so large the eye cannot contain it — the theoretical ground of cosmic horror's engagement with scale. *Infinity*: the mind's attempt to complete an endless pattern defeated by the pattern's refusal to end — mapping onto repetition structures in dream cinema (Brief 04) and analog horror's looping signals (Brief 02). *Suddenness*: the theoretical ground of the jump scare. *Intermitting*: the light that appears and disappears, the oscillation between visibility and obscurity — the strobe, the flickering screen, PHANTASMATA's digital-glitch aesthetic.

For PHANTASMATA, Burke provides two foundational principles. First, the *distance principle*: horror art converts real terror into delightful horror by establishing aesthetic distance. Found-digital formats are distance technologies — screens interpose a frame. But PHANTASMATA makes that frame unreliable, thinning the distance until the viewer is uncertain whether the frame holds. Second, the *epistemological sublime*: Burke's triggers are attacks on the knowledge system. Obscurity, darkness, vastness, intermission — all disable or overwhelm the faculties by which the subject models reality.

#### Kant: The Mathematical and the Dynamical

Kant's *Critique of Judgment* (1790) refines Burke into a transcendental framework. The *mathematical sublime*: imagination confronts an object so vast it cannot form a comprehensive representation — the failure paradoxically reveals reason's superiority over sensory experience. The *dynamical sublime*: the subject confronts overwhelming force from safety and recognizes moral reason's independence from physical destruction.

Kant's contribution: *cognitive conflict as sublime mechanism*. Burke located the sublime in the object's properties. Kant relocates it in the subject's cognitive apparatus — specifically, in imagination's failure to synthesize what reason can conceive. The sublime is not in the mountain but in the mind's inability to form an adequate image while simultaneously grasping the concept of totality. This gap is the sublime event.

For PHANTASMATA: the horror of $LYNCH_DRIFT is a mathematical sublime — the viewer follows the plot rationally but cannot synthesize the experience perceptually (you can describe *Mulholland Drive* but cannot make the description feel like watching it). Cosmic horror inverts the dynamical sublime — the entity so vast that moral reason provides no shelter. Lovecraft's "Great Old Ones" are dynamically sublime entities whose revelation is not the superiority of human reason but its irrelevance. The anti-Kantian sublime, destroying rather than elevating.

#### Radcliffe: Terror Expands, Horror Contracts

Ann Radcliffe's posthumous essay "On the Supernatural in Poetry" (1826) introduces the distinction organizing all subsequent horror theory. Terror "expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life." Horror "contracts, freezes, and nearly annihilates them." Terror opens; horror closes. Terror is the dark corridor; horror is what waits at its end. Physiologically: terror corresponds to the orienting response (heightened alertness, widened pupils); horror corresponds to the freeze response (immobilization, cognitive shutdown).

PHANTASMATA's preferred register is *terror* — expansion, heightened perception, scanning for anomaly. This is $LYNCH_DRIFT (the slowly dissolving reality anchor), $KON_SPIRAL (the mounting suspicion that the image lies), and the found-footage form's native mode (the camera that might show something). Terror sustains engagement because the terrified viewer is active — scanning, interpreting, constructing hypotheses. Horror risks shutting down engagement. PHANTASMATA operates predominantly in terror, reserving horror for rare, carefully calibrated punctuations.

#### The Gothic as Epistemological Instrument

The Gothic novel's deepest contribution is not its imagery (castles, veils, dungeons) but its formal structure as an epistemological instrument. The Gothic protagonist occupies a specific epistemic condition: in a space whose rules they do not understand, surrounded by uninterpretable evidence, receiving information through untrustworthy channels. Emily St. Aubert does not know what is behind the veil. Harker does not know the rules of the Count's castle. The reader shares this limited perspective.

PHANTASMATA inherits this structure. The found-digital output places the viewer in the Gothic epistemic condition: in a space (the digital interface) whose rules are uncertain, surrounded by evidence (timestamps, metadata, visual artifacts) they cannot fully interpret, receiving information through channels (screens, feeds) they cannot entirely trust. The Gothic castle is the phone screen. The veil is the loading bar. The incomprehensible manuscript is the corrupted file.

Radcliffe's "explained supernatural" — apparently supernatural events receiving naturalistic explanations — produces oscillation between credulity and skepticism that is the novelistic ancestor of "audience uncertainty is the design intent." Shelley's *Frankenstein* remains the foundational text for horror-as-epistemology: the monster is a product of knowledge, and the horror is that the knowledge works.

### B2. The Uncanny (1906–1970)

#### Jentsch: Intellectual Uncertainty

Ernst Jentsch's "On the Psychology of the Uncanny" (1906) identifies the uncanny with *intellectual uncertainty* — the inability to determine whether an apparently animate object is alive, or whether an apparently inanimate object might be. His examples: automata, waxwork figures, epileptic seizures. The uncanny arises from the *failure to categorize*.

For PHANTASMATA, Jentsch is more directly operational than Freud. The uncanny as intellectual uncertainty is the native condition of found-digital horror. A video-log shows a figure: person or shadow? A screen-capture displays a notification: system-generated or anomalous? An audio-log contains a voice: the subject's or someone else's? The uncanny derives not from what is shown but from the viewer's inability to determine what is shown.

#### Freud: The Return of the Repressed

Freud's "Das Unheimliche" (1919) is the most influential text in horror theory. Its core insight is etymological: *unheimlich* (unhomely, strange) negates *heimlich*, which means both "homely, familiar" and "hidden, concealed." The familiar and the secret converge. The *un*heimlich is not the irruption of the alien into the domestic but the *revelation of what was hidden within the domestic all along*.

Freud's uncanny triggers map directly onto PHANTASMATA's formal vocabulary. *The double*: the doppelganger, the mirror image that moves independently — $LYNCH_DRIFT's core territory (Lynch's *Lost Highway*, *Mulholland Drive*). *Repetition compulsion*: the involuntary return, the déjà vu — in PHANTASMATA, the notification that recurs, the file that reappears after deletion, the repeating timestamp. *The omnipotence of thoughts*: the magical belief that wishing causes events — J-horror's curse logic (Brief 06), transposed as the post that manifests its content. *The blurring of fantasy and reality*: uncertainty about whether an imagined event actually occurred — $KON_SPIRAL's territory, mediation collapse.

Freud's deepest claim: the uncanny is produced by the return of *infantile* cognitive modes (animistic thinking, magical causation) that adult rationality has repressed but not destroyed. The uncanny reveals that the rational subject is built on an irrational foundation that can reassert itself at any moment.

For PHANTASMATA: the uncanny requires the familiar as substrate — it cannot operate in already-alien environments. A haunted castle is threatening, not uncanny. A phone screen that displays something wrong is uncanny, because the phone is the most intimate object in contemporary life. Found-digital formats are uncanny technologies: they exploit intimate familiarity with digital interfaces to produce the recognition that the familiar harbors what is most foreign.

#### Mori: The Uncanny Valley

Masahiro Mori's uncanny valley (1970): as artificial entities approach human likeness, comfort increases — until just before perfect resemblance, where it plummets into revulsion. The entity that is *almost* human but not quite produces stronger negative affect than the obviously non-human. The valley is the zone of *almost-right*: the pattern-detection system identifies "human" but also identifies anomalies signaling "not-human," and the conflict produces the uncanny response.

For PHANTASMATA, the uncanny valley is a formal principle across all formats: the output should be *almost* a real document but not quite. The video-log almost indistinguishable from genuine personal recording but containing one inexplicable element. The mock-post following platform conventions precisely but with anomalous content. *Almost-right is more disturbing than obviously-wrong.* PHANTASMATA aims for the valley.

### B3. Noel Carroll and the Philosophy of Horror (1990)

#### The Monster and the Paradox

Carroll's *The Philosophy of Horror, or Paradoxes of the Heart* (1990) is the most systematic philosophical treatment of horror as aesthetic category. He defines "art-horror" as a specific response to a specific entity: the *monster* — a being that is simultaneously *threatening* (can harm) and *impure* (transgresses categorical boundaries). Four modes of transgression: *fusion* (combining separate categories — the living dead), *fission* (one identity in multiple bodies — the doppelganger), *magnification* (natural entity at monstrous scale), *massification* (natural entity in overwhelming numbers). Art-horror requires both cognitive recognition (the monster violates categories) and affective response (revulsion, dread).

The paradox of horror — why seek unpleasant experiences? — receives Carroll's *curiosity theory*: the horror narrative generates curiosity about the monster (what is it? what are its rules?) and the pleasure of satisfying curiosity compensates for the unpleasantness. Horror narratives are epistemological machines: engines for generating and satisfying curiosity about impossible entities. Carroll deserves credit for placing epistemology at horror's center.

#### Critiques: What Carroll Cannot See

Carroll's monster-dependent definition excludes PHANTASMATA's primary influences. No monster in *Mulholland Drive*. No monster in *Perfect Blue*. No monster in *Pulse*. No monster in *Lake Mungo*. No monster in Burke's sublime or Freud's uncanny. Carroll requires a discrete threatening entity, but the horror traditions PHANTASMATA draws on produce horror through *conditions*: identity dissolution, mediation collapse, reality's porosity, cosmic indifference. No entity threatens. A *state of affairs* threatens.

Schneider (2000): Carroll mistakes sufficient condition for necessary — monsters can produce art-horror, but art-horror can be produced without monsters. Freeland (2000): Carroll ignores the uncanny. Hills (2005): the curiosity theory cannot explain re-watching — if curiosity drives pleasure, pleasure should dissipate once the mystery is solved, but horror fans re-watch obsessively. The pleasure derives from the affect itself, from controlled fear, from formal satisfaction.

Carroll's failure is productive for PHANTASMATA. It identifies the boundary of monster-centered theory and points toward the territory beyond: horror through conditions rather than entities, through epistemological crisis rather than categorical transgression. PHANTASMATA's native territory. The project does not produce monsters. It produces conditions where monsters would be the least of your problems.

Carroll's curiosity theory, however, survives the monster critique. Even monsterless horror exploits curiosity: the *Mulholland Drive* viewer wants to know what is happening; the *Perfect Blue* viewer wants to know what is real. The curiosity redirects from "what is the monster?" to "what is the condition?" — but it operates with the same force. PHANTASMATA's found-digital outputs exploit this: the video-log viewer wants to know what is wrong with the footage; the screen-capture viewer wants to know why the interface behaves anomalously.

### B4. The Psychology of Fear

#### Threat Detection Architecture

Fear is an adaptive system with multi-level architecture that horror media exploits at every level.

The *startle reflex*: brainstem-mediated, 30-50 milliseconds, pre-cognitive. A sudden stimulus triggers involuntary muscular contraction and elevated heart rate before the stimulus is identified. The jump scare is Burke's "suddenness" reduced to its minimal physiological mechanism.

The *amygdala-mediated fear response*: 100-200 milliseconds, subcortical. LeDoux's "low road" from sensory thalamus to amygdala bypasses the cortex, producing fear based on crude threat assessment before conscious perception. This is why a coiled rope in dim light frightens before being identified. Horror exploits this by presenting ambiguous stimuli the amygdala evaluates as threatening while the cortex searches for resolution — the shape in darkness, the sound that might be a voice. Sustained ambiguity keeps the amygdala active while the cortex fails to resolve, producing chronic low-level fear qualitatively different from the startle spike.

*Conditioned fear*: learned association between neutral stimuli and aversive experiences. Watson's "Little Albert" (1920) demonstrated fear acquisition through pairing and generalization. The horror genre is a massive conditioning apparatus: conventions (darkness, silence, slow camera movements) have been paired with frightening payoffs so consistently that they now elicit anticipatory fear independently. The viewer who dreads a slow dolly down a dark corridor is experiencing conditioned fear from hundreds of prior horror encounters.

PHANTASMATA's found-digital formats share fewer conventions with established horror, which is both limitation (conditioned responses must be built, not exploited) and advantage (the viewer's guard is not raised by format recognition, so the first anomaly strikes an unprepared system). Serial output builds the conditioning: each encounter pairing format with anomaly strengthens the association.

#### Benign Masochism and Excitation Transfer

Paul Rozin's *benign masochism* (2013): humans systematically seek experiences producing negative affect — horror, spicy food, extreme sports, sad music. The body produces alarm; the mind simultaneously recognizes the threat is not real. Pleasure derives from the *discrepancy* between body-alarm and mind-safety. The body says "danger"; the mind says "safe"; the gap is exhilaration.

PHANTASMATA's found-digital formats narrow this gap by reducing cognitive safety. A video-log that might be real narrows the distance between body-alarm and safety-assessment. The narrower the gap, the more intense the benign masochism — but the gap must not close entirely, which would produce genuine distress rather than aesthetic pleasure.

Dolf Zillmann's *excitation transfer* (1971): physiological arousal from one stimulus can be misattributed to a subsequent stimulus if temporally proximate. Horror's tension-and-relief cycles produce escalation through residual arousal accumulation. For PHANTASMATA, excitation transfer operates *across outputs*: a disturbing video-log's residual arousal colors the viewer's subsequent ordinary phone activity with transferred threat. The phone screen that displayed the horror output is the same screen displaying text messages, and excitation transfer means it now carries residual dread.

#### Pattern Detection and Pareidolia

The human perceptual system is calibrated for threat-detection *sensitivity* over *specificity*: better to detect a nonexistent tiger (false positive) than miss a real one (false negative). This produces systematic false positives — *pareidolia* — perception of meaningful patterns in random data (faces in clouds, figures in static, voices in white noise).

Horror exploits pareidolia with stimuli ambiguous enough to activate pattern detection without resolving it. Found-digital formats are pareidolia engines: low-resolution video, compressed audio, degraded images produce noise in which the pattern-detection system finds patterns that may not exist. The viewer frightens themselves. The output provides conditions; the viewer's perceptual architecture provides the content. The degraded image is not merely an authenticity marker (Brief 01, Technique 2) — it is a pareidolia field.

### B5. Cosmic Horror and Weird Fiction

#### Lovecraft: Fear of the Unknown

Lovecraft's "Supernatural Horror in Literature" (1927): "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown." Not the not-yet-known but the *unknowable* — a permanent ontological category. Lovecraft's fiction enacts this through a specific structure: a rationalist protagonist encounters evidence of entities exceeding human cognitive capacity. The encounter threatens not life but *worldview* — the assumption that the universe is structured for human comprehension. The cosmic horror revelation: it is not. Reality operates by principles human cognition cannot access. Knowledge does not converge on truth; it converges on madness, because the truth exceeds the mind.

Lovecraft's formal signature is the *inadequacy of description*: narrators report that entities are "indescribable," "unnameable." This is formal strategy: if the entity could be described, it could be known; if known, categorized; if categorized, it would not produce cosmic horror. The descriptive failure *is* the horror.

For PHANTASMATA: horror as the affect of the unknowable. An output that does not show something frightening but something that *cannot be processed* — an image resisting interpretation, a sound resisting identification, a narrative resisting comprehension. The horror is the viewer's recognition that their interpretive apparatus has failed.

#### Ligotti: Consciousness as Horror

Thomas Ligotti's *The Conspiracy Against the Human Race* (2010) extends Lovecraft into explicit philosophical pessimism, drawing on Schopenhauer, Zapffe, and Cioran. Consciousness itself is horror — not consciousness *of* horror but consciousness *as* horror. Self-awareness, mortality recognition, and suffering anticipation are sources of intrinsic torment. The "conspiracy" is the network of mechanisms (religion, entertainment, love, ambition) by which humans conceal from themselves the horror of being conscious.

Ligotti identifies horror with *consciousness itself* rather than any object of consciousness. Self-awareness is the horror. The knowledge that you know is the dread. This is horror-as-epistemology's logical terminus: horror is not something external attacking the knowledge system; horror is what the knowledge system discovers when it turns on itself.

For PHANTASMATA production: Ligotti's absolute pessimism is too static for creative artifacts, but his identification of *concealment mechanisms* is operational. An output that peels back one layer of concealment — that briefly exposes the mechanism by which the viewer protects themselves from awareness — operates in Ligotti's register without requiring full metaphysical commitment.

#### Thacker: The World-Without-Us

Eugene Thacker's *Horror of Philosophy* trilogy — *In the Dust of This Planet* (2011), *Starry Speculative Corpse* (2015), *Tentacles Longer Than Night* (2015) — theorizes horror not as a genre analyzed by philosophy but as philosophical practice.

Thacker's central concept: three distinctions. The *world-for-us* (the world structured by human categories). The *world-in-itself* (the Kantian noumenon, target of science). The *world-without-us* (the world that actively resists human comprehension — not unknowable-in-principle but *against* knowing). Horror is the genre that thinks the world-without-us. Philosophy thinks the world-in-itself through metaphysics and epistemology. Horror thinks the world-without-us — the world that destroys thought, that exists as the annihilation of the thinking subject.

For PHANTASMATA: the concept completing the epistemological framework. Horror thinks the *limit* of epistemology — the point where knowledge encounters the unknowable and recognizes the encounter as final. The world-without-us is the horizon: the recognition that the world does not require human knowing, that reality is indifferent to consciousness, and that this indifference is permanent.

#### Fisher: The Weird and the Eerie

Mark Fisher's *The Weird and the Eerie* (2016) refines cosmic horror into two categories mapping cleanly onto PHANTASMATA production strategies.

The *weird*: wrong presence — the thing that should not be there. Lovecraft's monsters violate the ontological categories of the world they invade. The affect: fascinated revulsion, the inability to look away or to comprehend.

The *eerie*: wrong absence — the absence of what should be present, or presence where nothing should be. Deserted landscapes, entities operating without apparent agency, patterns suggesting intentionality from unidentifiable sources. The eerie's questions: *why is there nothing where there should be something? Why is there something where there should be nothing?*

Direct operational mapping: the weird maps onto $ARGENTO_GEL (wrong visual presence, excessive color, the surplus that exceeds the frame). The eerie maps onto $LYNCH_DRIFT (wrong absence, dissolved mundane anchors, the vacancy where familiarity should be). $KON_SPIRAL operates where weird and eerie overlap: the mediation collapse is simultaneously wrong presence (the image that persists, the recording that should not exist) and wrong absence (the reality that should anchor the image but has disappeared).

### B6. Horror and the Body

#### Kristeva: The Abject

Julia Kristeva's *Powers of Horror* (1980) theorizes the dimension Burke, Kant, Freud, and Carroll underemphasize: horror of the body, of bodily boundaries, of what crosses between inside and outside, self and other, living and dead.

The *abject*: what the subject expels to constitute itself — excrement, blood, pus, the corpse. Not an *object* (standing opposite the subject) but a condition threatening the subject/object boundary. The corpse is paradigmatic: the human body that is no longer a subject, confronting the living with the knowledge that the boundary is crossable. Abjection operates through *boundary violation*: inside/outside, self/other, living/dead, human/animal, clean/contaminated.

Mary Douglas's *Purity and Danger* (1966) provides the anthropological framework: pollution and taboo are generated by *matter out of place*. Dirt is not a substance but a classification — matter appearing where the cultural system says it should not. Different cultures draw different boundaries. Horror must be calibrated to its audience's classification system.

Barbara Creed's *The Monstrous-Feminine* (1993) extends abjection into feminist analysis: the horror genre's boundary-violations are specifically gendered, coding the female body as inherently more categorically unstable than the male.

For PHANTASMATA: Kristeva maps onto $GRINDHOUSE (raw exploitation texture) and body horror within $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS. But the subtler application is to found-digital formats. The found-digital document performs boundary crossing at the format level: private made public (video-log not intended for this audience), fictional content in factual streams (mock-post in real-seeming feed), the digital interior made exterior (metadata revealing what the conscious self did not intend to disclose). Digital abjection: the browser history, the deleted messages, the cached images — the digital inside becoming digital outside.

### B7. Contemporary Horror Theory

#### Clover, Wood, Lowenstein, Cohen

Carol Clover's *Men, Women, and Chain Saws* (1992) demonstrated that horror's identification structures are mobile and unstable — the viewer shifts between positions (voyeur, victim, killer) throughout the narrative. For PHANTASMATA: found-digital formats intensify this mobility. The video-log viewer shifts between identifying with the operator, the subject, and the future viewer who will find this footage. Positional instability is itself an epistemic anxiety.

Robin Wood's "An Introduction to the American Horror Film" (1979) applies Marcuse's Marx-Freud synthesis: horror cinema enacts the *return of the repressed* — what society has suppressed (sexuality, otherness, the unconscious) irrupting into cultural production. The monster is always a figure for the repressed. PHANTASMATA's found-digital fragments, having no conventional ending, resist both conservative resolution (monster destroyed, normality restored) and subversive resolution (monster triumphant). The fragment's incompleteness means the repressed material remains in circulation, unresolved.

Adam Lowenstein's *Shocking Representation* (2005): horror processes historical trauma that realist representation cannot address. Hiroshima produced *Godzilla*; Vietnam produced *Texas Chain Saw Massacre*. The *allegorical moment*: where historical trauma and generic convention converge. PHANTASMATA processes a specific historical trauma: the epistemological crisis of the digital present — compromised information channels, collapsed epistemic authority, chronic diffuse anxiety about what is real. The corrupted video-log is simultaneously horror artifact and image of the compromised information channel.

Jeffrey Jerome Cohen's "Monster Culture (Seven Theses)" (1996): the monster's body is a cultural body embodying a culture's fears; the monster always escapes; the monster is the harbinger of category crisis. For PHANTASMATA, which produces conditions rather than monsters, Cohen's framework applies to the conditions themselves: the corrupted interface embodies fear of digital unreliability; the identity blur dwells at the gates of difference; the mediation collapse stands at the threshold of becoming.

### B8. Horror as Epistemology — The PHANTASMATA Synthesis

The traditions mapped in B1-B7 converge. Each identifies a specific mode of epistemological failure:

**Burke's sublime**: failure of *perceptual containment*. The mind confronts what it cannot assimilate. In PHANTASMATA: the image exceeding the frame ($ARGENTO_GEL high), the sound overwhelming the microphone.

**Kant's cognitive conflict**: failure of *synthesis*. Imagination and reason irreconcilable. In PHANTASMATA: the output rationally describable but experientially unintegrable.

**Radcliffe's terror/horror**: failure of *anticipation* vs. failure of *response*. PHANTASMATA operates primarily in terror (expansion, scanning) with rare horror (contraction, freeze).

**Jentsch's intellectual uncertainty**: failure of *categorization*. In PHANTASMATA: the native condition of found-digital media — the viewer unable to determine if the output is authentic or fabricated.

**Freud's uncanny**: failure of *repression*. The familiar reveals the foreign. In PHANTASMATA: the phone screen harboring what should remain hidden.

**Carroll's art-horror**: failure of *categorical integrity*. PHANTASMATA's correction: categorical violation does not require a monster — conditions suffice.

**Psychology of fear**: failures of the *threat-detection system*. Startle, conditioned response, pattern detection in noise, amygdala activation without cortical resolution.

**Kristeva's abjection**: failure of *bodily boundaries*. In found-digital form: the private document exposed, the digital interior made exterior.

**Lovecraft's cosmic horror**: failure of *comprehension*. The entity exceeding all categories, revealing human knowledge's inadequacy.

**Thacker's world-without-us**: failure of *anthropocentrism*. The world indifferent to consciousness — not a problem to solve but a permanent condition.

**Fisher's weird and eerie**: two modes — wrong presence (surplus exceeding the frame) and wrong absence (vacancy where meaning should be). The dials: $ARGENTO_GEL (weird), $LYNCH_DRIFT (eerie), $KON_SPIRAL (convergence).

The synthesis: horror is not a genre. It is a mode of knowing that activates when normal epistemological operations fail. It is the mind's registration of its own breakdown — the affect that accompanies the recognition that perception, cognition, memory, identity, communication, or categorical structure has ceased to function reliably. PHANTASMATA does not produce horror content. It produces the conditions under which the viewer's epistemological apparatus encounters its own limits. The dread is not the monster, the ghost, the killer, or the curse. The dread is the knowledge that knowing has broken — and that the break may not be reparable.

This synthesis has a concrete implication for production. Each of the eleven traditions identifies a different *target* within the knowledge system. A PHANTASMATA output that attacks perception ($ARGENTO_GEL, deploying Burke's sublime) produces a different quality of dread than one that attacks identity ($LYNCH_DRIFT, deploying Freud's uncanny), which produces a different quality than one that attacks mediation ($KON_SPIRAL, deploying Kon's recursion). The three director dials are, understood through this framework, *epistemological targeting instruments*: each dial selects which component of the knowledge system the output will attack. The dial settings determine the intensity of the attack. The five output formats determine the medium through which the attack is delivered. And the twenty techniques inventoried in Section C are the specific methods of attack.

This is what "horror as epistemology, not genre decoration" means in production terms: every creative decision — dial setting, format selection, technique deployment — is an epistemological decision about which component of the viewer's knowledge system to target, how intensely to target it, and through what medium. Horror that decorates does not make these decisions deliberately; it reaches for genre conventions (jump scares, darkness, ominous music) without understanding what epistemic operation each convention targets. Horror that investigates makes every decision with full awareness of its epistemological function.

## C) Techniques Inventory

**1. The Paradox of Controlled Fear**
*Definition:* Deliberate production of fear within a context sufficiently safe for the fear to register as pleasurable (Rozin's benign masochism). *Horror function:* Establishes the affective contract — the audience agrees to be frightened on condition of safety. PHANTASMATA's found-digital formats complicate this by narrowing the perceived safety margin. *Examples:* Every horror artifact; the haunted house attraction; the creepypasta read at 3AM. *Application:* Outputs mimicking real documents thin the margin; the margin must be thinned but not eliminated. *Format affinity:* All five formats.

**2. The Uncanny Recognition**
*Definition:* Rendering the familiar as strange by introducing a single anomalous element into otherwise ordinary context (Freud's unheimlich). *Horror function:* Attacks the assumption that familiar environments are safe. The anomaly must be subtle enough that the viewer is uncertain whether they perceived it correctly. *Examples:* Lynch's suburban interiors concealing cosmic dread; the video-log with one wrong background detail; the screen-capture with one changed icon. *Application:* Every output should contain at least one element of uncanny recognition — one detail that is not quite right, discoverable but not obvious. *Format affinity:* Video-log (visual anomaly), screen-capture (interface anomaly), mock-post (tonal anomaly).

**3. The Abject Boundary Crossing**
*Definition:* Violating boundaries the audience treats as natural: inside/outside, private/public, living/dead, real/fabricated (Kristeva, Douglas). *Horror function:* Produces ontological distress by demonstrating that apparently natural boundaries are cultural constructions. *Examples:* Body horror (Cronenberg); digital abjection (exposed browser history); the corpse. *Application:* Found-digital outputs perform boundary crossing at format level — private document made public, fictional content in factual stream. *Format affinity:* Video-log (private/public), text-fragment (fiction/nonfiction), mock-post (entertainment/evidence).

**4. The Cosmic Indifference**
*Definition:* Positioning the human subject within a frame revealing the universe's indifference to human existence (Lovecraft, Ligotti, Thacker). *Horror function:* Attacks anthropocentrism. Produces dread through irrelevance rather than threat. *Examples:* Lovecraft's indifferent entities; the final shot of *Pulse*; Ligotti's narrators. *Application:* Outputs positioning the viewer as irrelevant — the video-log recording events to which the operator is incidental, the screen-capture capturing autonomous processes, the text-fragment addressing no audience. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (unintended recordings), screen-capture (automated processes).

**5. The Epistemic Failure**
*Definition:* Producing the viewer's direct experience of their interpretive apparatus failing — sufficient information to trigger pattern recognition, insufficient to complete the pattern, leaving cognition in irresolvable activation. *Horror function:* The core technique of horror-as-epistemology. Distinguished from confusion (frustrating, not frightening) by the presence of enough coherent signal to activate interpretation without completing it. *Examples:* The ambiguous figure in *Marble Hornets*; the unexplained sound in *Paranormal Activity*; the photograph in *Lake Mungo*. *Application:* Primary technique. Every output should contain at least one genuinely ambiguous element the viewer's system cannot resolve. *Format affinity:* All five formats.

**6. The Conditioned Anticipation**
*Definition:* Establishing patterns across serial outputs so the audience develops conditioned anticipatory responses to the format itself (Pavlov, Watson). *Horror function:* Transforms the neutral stimulus (the format) into a conditioned stimulus producing dread before any anomaly appears. *Examples:* *Paranormal Activity*'s time-lapse producing dread before anything happens; analog horror channels conditioning vigilance; NoSleep's "everything is true" rule. *Application:* Serial deployment consistently pairing format with anomaly. Conditioning transfers across formats: once video-logs establish dread, mock-posts from the same source inherit it. *Format affinity:* All five (serial deployment).

**7. The Sublime Overwhelm**
*Definition:* Perceptual experience exceeding cognitive assimilation capacity — too much information, too rapid a flow (Burke, Kant). *Horror function:* Disables rational processing, producing affect without cognitive mediation. *Examples:* Argento's *Suspiria* (sensory saturation); *Unfriended*'s desktop during crisis; Lynch's industrial soundscapes. *Application:* Outputs approaching saturation — multiple overlapping audio sources, multiple windows in crisis. Must be used sparingly; sustained overwhelm produces numbness. *Format affinity:* Video-log (visual + auditory density), screen-capture (interface overload), audio-log (layered ambient).

**8. The Wrong Absence**
*Definition:* Dread produced through removal of something that should be present (Fisher's eerie). *Horror function:* The fear of what is *not* there. Requires prior conditioning — the audience must expect the absent element. *Examples:* Lynch's empty rooms that feel occupied; the screen-capture where a file has disappeared; the serial output where a consistent element vanishes. *Application:* Serial outputs with a consistent element that disappears between installments without acknowledgment. *Format affinity:* Video-log (missing objects), screen-capture (disappeared files), text-fragment (redacted content).

**9. The Wrong Presence**
*Definition:* An element that does not belong in context — a figure where none should be, a file not created by the user (Fisher's weird). *Horror function:* Violates the viewer's model of the output's reality. Must imply agency from an unidentified source. *Examples:* Slender Man at frame's edge in *Marble Hornets*; the extra participant in *Host*; the uncreated file in *Searching*. *Application:* One element the format cannot explain — a notification from unknown source, a background figure, metadata contradicting internal chronology. *Format affinity:* Video-log (background anomaly), screen-capture (unauthorized element), mock-post (reply from unknown account).

**10. The Dual Causality**
*Definition:* Sustaining two simultaneous explanations — naturalistic and non-naturalistic — without resolving either (Todorov's "fantastic," Radcliffe's explained supernatural). *Horror function:* Sustains epistemic oscillation — the viewer cannot determine whether anomalies indicate something genuinely wrong or merely mundane malfunction. This is Radcliffe's terror: expanded, hyperattentive uncertainty. *Examples:* Dark Water's leaking ceiling; video-log artifacts (corruption or content?). *Application:* Every output should sustain dual causality. Every anomaly needs a mundane explanation just plausible enough to prevent resolution. *Format affinity:* All five formats.

**11. The Excitation Bleed**
*Definition:* Allowing the affective charge to contaminate the viewer's subsequent engagement with the non-horror context from which the output was accessed (Zillmann's excitation transfer). *Horror function:* Extends horror beyond the output's temporal boundaries — the platform, device, or interface acquires residual threat. *Examples:* Ringu's curse logic (the television becomes portal); the creepypasta making the reader's phone feel contaminated. *Application:* Outputs consumed within the same interfaces used for daily life — the video-log on the texting phone, the mock-post in the news feed. Same medium maximizes bleed. *Format affinity:* Screen-capture (consumed on the screen it depicts), mock-post (consumed within the feed it impersonates).

**12. The Pareidolia Field**
*Definition:* Visual or auditory noise at sufficient density to activate pattern detection without providing enough signal to resolve patterns into identifiable objects. *Horror function:* The viewer generates their own threatening patterns from ambiguous stimuli — frightens themselves. The output provides substrate; the viewer's perceptual architecture provides content. *Examples:* Low-light footage with noise; background audio with ambiguous voices; analog horror static seeming to contain images. *Application:* Found-digital degradation calibrated not merely as authenticity marker but as pareidolia substrate — ambiguous enough to activate threat detection, clear enough that activation cannot be dismissed as random. *Format affinity:* Video-log (visual noise), audio-log (auditory noise), screen-capture (interface artifacts).

**13. The Identity Dissolution**
*Definition:* Gradually undermining certainty about a character's identity, consistency, or existence (Freud's double, Lynch's identity blur, Buñuel's substitution). *Horror function:* Attacks the assumption that characters are stable entities. Produces dread through recognition that identity — the most basic narrative unit — cannot be trusted. *Examples:* *Lost Highway* (Fred becomes Pete); *Perfect Blue* (Mima's multiple selves); found footage with subtly changing operator voice. *Application:* Serial outputs eroding subject consistency — different vocal quality, contradictory details, changing username. $LYNCH_DRIFT's primary technique. *Format affinity:* Video-log (visual/vocal erosion), text-fragment (voice shift), mock-post (account instability).

**14. The Mediation Collapse**
*Definition:* Undermining trust in the medium through which the output is received — not the content but the channel (Kon, McLuhan, $KON_SPIRAL). *Horror function:* The recognition that the medium may be an active participant in distortion rather than a neutral window. *Examples:* Ringu's cursed tape; the corrupted file that might be corruption or content; the unauthorized notification. *Application:* Outputs attacking their own medium — the video-log glitching the player interface, the screen-capture whose anomalies appear to extend beyond the capture, the mock-post with impossible metadata. *Format affinity:* Screen-capture (primary), video-log (player anomalies), mock-post (platform-behavior anomalies).

**15. The Sustained Ambiguity**
*Definition:* Maintaining epistemic uncertainty past the point where conventional narrative would resolve it — refusing to answer, never confirming reality status, ending without closure (Radcliffe's terror, found-footage's resistance to resolution). *Horror function:* Denies cognitive closure. The fear response cannot terminate because the stimulus has not been resolved as threat or non-threat. The system remains in activation. *Examples:* *Blair Witch*'s ending; *Lake Mungo*'s final revelation; the creepypasta ending with "I don't know what happened next." *Application:* Fragments do not conclude; they stop. No output provides full resolution. The audience's uncertainty is maintained across outputs — new outputs raise questions rather than answering previous ones. *Format affinity:* All five formats.

**16. The Temporal Contamination**
*Definition:* Disrupting the assumption of linear temporality — timestamps contradicting sequence, events preceding causes, footage predating the camera that recorded it (Ju-On, dream cinema, Freud's repetition compulsion). *Horror function:* Attacks chronological sequence, the most basic organizing principle of narrative. Particularly effective in found-digital formats where timestamps create temporal reliability expectations. *Examples:* Ju-On's non-chronological structure; *Noroi*'s assembled timeline; video-logs with contradictory timestamps. *Application:* Metadata as horror tool — timestamps that jump, creation dates predating the technology, modification dates postdating the creator's disappearance. *Format affinity:* Video-log (timestamps), screen-capture (system clock), text-fragment (contradictory dates), mock-post (impossible sequence).

**17. The Threshold Oscillation**
*Definition:* Rapidly alternating between mundane and anomalous at increasing frequency, producing hypervigilance (Burke's "intermitting," conditioned fear). *Horror function:* Conditions the viewer to anticipate disturbance during every moment of normalcy, transforming safe intervals into dread. Each return to normalcy is less reassuring than the last. *Examples:* *Paranormal Activity*'s day/night alternation; analog horror channels alternating normal and disturbing uploads; Lynch's tonal shifts. *Application:* Serial outputs alternating innocuous and disturbing content, with disturbing proportion increasing. The audience should lose confidence in "safe" outputs. *Format affinity:* All five (serial deployment).

**18. The Institutional Failure**
*Definition:* Positioning an authoritative institution as information mediator and demonstrating its authority is compromised (Watkins's institutional fake, Gothic institutional framing, Lowenstein's allegorical processing). *Horror function:* Attacks the assumption that institutional authority provides epistemic safety. When the institution fails, the viewer loses a higher-order security source. *Examples:* *Ghostwatch*'s BBC as haunted institution; the SCP Foundation's clinical documentation; *Gonjiam*'s platform metrics driving danger. *Application:* Outputs mimicking institutional documents — moderation notices, automated notifications, official communications — that reveal institutional failure. The platform notification that should not have been sent. *Format affinity:* Text-fragment (institutional document), mock-post (platform communication), screen-capture (automated system anomaly).

**19. The Recursive Self-Awareness**
*Definition:* An output containing evidence of awareness of being an output — a video-log showing the subject watching a previous video-log, a screen-capture capturing a screen showing a screen-capture (Kon's recursion, mise en abyme, Hofstadter's strange loop). *Horror function:* Ontological vertigo — stable reality undermined by the discovery that the output occupies multiple levels simultaneously with permeable boundaries. *Examples:* *Perfect Blue* (Mima watching herself watching herself); *Deadstream*'s host watching chat react; *Marble Hornets*' protagonist watching undocumented tapes of himself. *Application:* Outputs referencing other outputs, creating a self-referential network. The video-log showing the subject receiving a mock-post from a previous cycle. $KON_SPIRAL's primary technique. *Format affinity:* All five (requires cross-format deployment).

**20. The Silence as Signal**
*Definition:* Extended silence or content absence deployed as positive horror element — silence *as* signal, communicating that something occupies the space sound should fill (Lynch's sonic voids, Burke's intermission). *Horror function:* Exploits the auditory system's threat-detection bias: silence in an environment that should contain sound implies something has silenced the expected sounds. *Examples:* Lynch's sudden voids in *Twin Peaks*; found-footage night sequences where ambient sound ceases; the audio-log that goes silent while recording continues. *Application:* Outputs with extended silence — video-log audio dropout during continued recording, audio-log capturing minutes of nothing, screen-capture where notifications cease. Must be contextualized (preceded by normal ambient) to register as anomalous. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (primary), video-log (audio dropout), screen-capture (notification silence).

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### The Three Dials Through the Epistemological Lens

Each dial targets a different component of the knowledge system.

**$ARGENTO_GEL (0-100)** targets *perception*. Low settings (0-30): perceptual channel intact, image legible. Mid settings (30-60): distortion begins — color saturates beyond naturalism, shadows reorganize spatial logic. This is Burke's sublime applied to the visual field. High settings (60-100): perception unreliable — the image so chromatically aggressive the viewer cannot trust it as representation. This is Fisher's weird manifesting as wrong color. In found-digital: color distortion ambiguously technological (phone auto-exposure in colored lighting) or anomalous (no plausible source).

**$LYNCH_DRIFT (0-100)** targets *identity and spatial coherence*. Low (0-30): stable identity, coherent spaces, mundane anchor holds. Mid (30-60): the mundane dissolves — familiar spaces acquire wrongness, subject's consistency erodes, temporal continuity develops gaps. This is Freud's uncanny. High (60-100): identity fractures, space becomes non-navigable. Fisher's eerie — wrong absence of what should anchor reality. In found-digital: slow erosion of consistency across serial outputs — voice changing, background details shifting, location becoming unrecognizable.

**$KON_SPIRAL (0-100)** targets *mediation*. Low (0-30): transparent mediation — screen as window, recording as record. Mid (30-60): mediation becomes opaque — screen behaves autonomously, recording contradicts memory, document generates rather than records. The channel becomes a distortion source. High (60-100): mediation collapsed — distinction between event and representation dissolved, recording more real than the event, identity indistinguishable from mediated image. Kon's *Perfect Blue* territory. In found-digital: the output attacking its own medium — the video-log recording events the camera caused, the screen-capture revealing uninitiated processes.

### Horror That Decorates vs. Horror That Investigates

**Decorative horror** uses horror elements (darkness, blood, jump scares) as ornament on an otherwise conventional narrative. Remove them and the underlying story remains. The horror is detachable seasoning.

**Investigative horror** uses horror as an epistemological instrument. Remove the horror and the work ceases to exist, because the horror *is* the investigation. Lynch, Kon, Lovecraft, Thacker — all produce horror inseparable from the epistemological inquiry it conducts.

PHANTASMATA produces investigative horror. The criteria:

1. *No detachable horror elements.* If describable without mentioning epistemological disturbance, the horror was decoration.
2. *The anomaly resists explanation.* Not withheld answers but unanswerable questions — "What happened to reality?" is unanswerable because the framework for answers has become unreliable.
3. *The viewer's interpretive apparatus is the target.* Not emotions targeted but the capacity to categorize, to distinguish real from fictional, to maintain a consistent model.
4. *The medium is implicated.* Not transparent delivery but the viewer aware the medium may participate in the disturbance.
5. *Sustained dread over affective spikes.* Baseline anxiety elevation that does not resolve, because the source (epistemological disturbance) is a condition, not an event.

### Quality Thresholds for PHANTASMATA Output

**Threshold 1: Epistemic disturbance is present.** At least one moment of genuine uncertainty about the output's nature — real or fictional, accidental or intentional, meaningless or significant.

**Threshold 2: Dual causality is sustained.** Every anomaly has both a plausible mundane explanation and a plausible non-mundane explanation. Neither confirmable from the output alone.

**Threshold 3: The medium is implicated.** The viewer becomes at least momentarily aware of the medium as potential participant in the disturbance.

**Threshold 4: The format is native.** Indistinguishable in format from a genuine document of its type. The format does not signal "horror" — horror emerges from content disturbing the format's conventions.

**Threshold 5: Resolution is withheld.** The output does not resolve its central ambiguity. The viewer leaves with more questions, and the questions concern the reliability of the information channel itself.

These thresholds are epistemological requirements. If an output fails any threshold, it has produced horror-as-decoration, not horror-as-epistemology.

### Cross-References to Other Briefs

This report's conceptual vocabulary operates across all other briefs in the series. The following map indicates where each philosophical/psychological concept finds its primary formal expression:

- **World Research Brief 01 (Found Footage as Form):** The found-footage form is an epistemological instrument. The diegetic camera is a technology for producing Burke's obscurity and Jentsch's intellectual uncertainty. The "why are they still filming?" problem is Carroll's curiosity drive in narrative form. The degraded image is simultaneously authenticity marker and pareidolia field. The found-footage form's forty-year evolution is a history of strategies for sustaining Radcliffe's terror against the erosion of audience literacy.

- **World Research Brief 02 (Digital Paranoia):** Internet-native horror is horror-as-epistemology in its most contemporary form. The collapse of fiction/platform boundary is Freud's uncanny operating at industrial scale — the familiar interface (heimlich) revealed as harboring the foreign (unheimlich). The SCP Foundation's clinical documentation deploys Carroll's curiosity theory through institutional-document aesthetics. NoSleep's "everything is true here" rule is Todorov's fantastic made into platform policy. Analog horror's obsolete-media aesthetics produce the uncanny valley at the media-format level: the VHS signal is *almost* a real broadcast but not quite.

- **World Research Brief 03 (Giallo Ecosystem):** Argento's color-as-weapon is Burke's sublime (perceptual overwhelm through chromatic excess) and Fisher's weird (wrong visual presence). The giallo's non-linear mystery structure deploys Carroll's curiosity drive while Radcliffe's sustained terror operates through the form's refusal to provide rational explanations at the pace the viewer requires.

- **World Research Brief 04 (Dream Cinema):** Dream cinema renders the epistemological conditions this report theorizes. The surrealist cut is epistemic failure made visible. Tarkovsky's temporal distortion is Kant's cognitive conflict (imagination and reason irreconcilable). Buñuel's identity substitution (*Obscure Object of Desire*) is Freud's double deployed without the acknowledgment that would transform uncanny into mere device. Deren's *Meshes of the Afternoon* is repetition compulsion as cinematic structure.

- **World Research Brief 06 (Asian Horror):** J-horror's cursed-media-object is mediation collapse ($KON_SPIRAL) given narrative form. Ringu's equation (watching = infection) is horror-as-epistemology's definitive popular expression: the act of knowing (watching) is the source of the threat. Kurosawa's *Pulse* is Thacker's world-without-us rendered as digital ghost story — the internet as the space where human loneliness and cosmic indifference converge. Ju-On's non-linear temporality deploys Freud's repetition compulsion as spatial-curse architecture.

### The Epistemological Spectrum

A final operational tool: the spectrum from mildest to most extreme epistemological disturbance, calibrated for PHANTASMATA production.

**Level 1 — Perceptual Anomaly:** Something in the output is visually or auditorily wrong, but the wrongness has a plausible technical explanation. Dual causality intact. The viewer notices but cannot be certain. Techniques: Uncanny Recognition (2), Pareidolia Field (12), Dual Causality (10). Dial range: $ARGENTO_GEL 10-30, $LYNCH_DRIFT 10-20, $KON_SPIRAL 0-10. Most outputs should operate at minimum at this level.

**Level 2 — Consistency Erosion:** Something in the output contradicts a previous output or contradicts itself internally, but the contradiction could be accidental. The viewer's model of the output-world begins to destabilize. Techniques: Identity Dissolution (13), Temporal Contamination (16), Wrong Absence (8). Dial range: $LYNCH_DRIFT 30-50, $KON_SPIRAL 20-40. Effective in serial deployment.

**Level 3 — Medium Disturbance:** The output's anomalies appear to affect the medium through which it is consumed — the player glitches, the interface behaves anomalously, the format's conventions are violated in ways that cannot be attributed to production error. The viewer becomes aware of the screen as potentially compromised. Techniques: Mediation Collapse (14), Excitation Bleed (11), Wrong Presence (9). Dial range: $KON_SPIRAL 40-60, $ARGENTO_GEL 40-60. Use selectively.

**Level 4 — Epistemic Crisis:** The output produces genuine uncertainty about the viewer's own act of perception and interpretation. Is this a real document? Did I just see what I think I saw? Am I interpreting this correctly, or has my interpretation been manipulated? The viewer's confidence in their own cognitive apparatus is temporarily shaken. Techniques: Epistemic Failure (5), Sustained Ambiguity (15), Recursive Self-Awareness (19). Dial range: $LYNCH_DRIFT 60-80, $KON_SPIRAL 60-80. Reserve for peak moments.

**Level 5 — Ontological Vertigo:** The output attacks the viewer's assumption that reality is structured for human comprehension. The anomalies do not merely resist explanation — they resist the framework within which explanations are formulated. The viewer encounters the limit of their interpretive apparatus and recognizes it as a limit. Techniques: Cosmic Indifference (4), Sublime Overwhelm (7), all three dials at high settings simultaneously. Extremely rare. One output per cycle at most. This is PHANTASMATA at its theoretical maximum: the moment where horror ceases to be about what threatens the self and becomes about the self's irrelevance to the world it inhabits.
