## A) Topic Definition and Scope

Sound is horror's most potent delivery mechanism. Not its most celebrated — that distinction belongs to the image — but its most physiologically direct, most resistant to rational defense, and most difficult to analyze in the moment of its operation. A viewer can close their eyes. They cannot close their ears. A viewer can identify a rubber mask and discharge the horror through recognition of artifice. They cannot identify, in real time, that a sustained 19Hz tone is producing the sensation of a presence in the room, that the sub-bass drone beneath dialogue is raising cortisol levels, that the absence of room tone registers as wrongness before any visible threat appears. Sound bypasses the analytical faculties images must negotiate. It arrives at the nervous system before the conscious mind has processed it.

PHANTASMATA's 6 craft mechanisms include "Layered sound design (70s prog/synth, diegetic hiss, Lynchian silence, glitchy digital)" as mechanism number four. This brief maps its formal history and creative deployment across six decades. The scope consolidates *horror scoring* (composed music accompanying horror imagery) and *horror sound design* (the non-musical sonic environment — ambient noise, room tone, foley, silence — constituting the acoustic architecture within which scoring operates). The consolidation is necessary because the most important developments have occurred at the boundary between these categories. Herrmann's Psycho strings are a score. Splet's Eraserhead soundscape is design. Stetson's Hereditary is both simultaneously — scored through extended saxophone technique producing tones indistinguishable from industrial machinery and organic distress. The trajectory from Herrmann to Stetson is a trajectory toward dissolution of the music/sound boundary, and PHANTASMATA inherits that dissolution.

The three director dials all have explicit sonic signatures. $ARGENTO_GEL: "Goblin-score intensity" — aggressive prog-rock scoring as assault weapon and Pavlovian trigger. $LYNCH_DRIFT: "industrial sonic" — electrical hum, machine drone, silence-as-presence, room-tone manipulation. $KON_SPIRAL: media-within-media audio — the sound from the screen within the screen, the recording within the recording, the artifact signaling mediation collapse. Each maps a distinct sonic philosophy: $ARGENTO_GEL deploys sound as maximalist weapon; $LYNCH_DRIFT deploys silence as minimalist dread; $KON_SPIRAL deploys audio mediation as ontological vertigo.

Sound is the sense most native to PHANTASMATA's found-digital production mode. Of five output formats, three are inherently sonic (video-log, screen-capture, audio-log). The audio-log is this domain's primary vehicle: pure sound forcing the listener to construct the visual, which is invariably worse than anything a production budget could render.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What physiological mechanisms produce sound-as-dread, and how have composers and designers exploited them?
2. How did the classical horror score (Herrmann, Penderecki, Goldsmith) establish orchestral dissonance as horror's foundational vocabulary?
3. What did the Italian tradition — Goblin, Morricone, Frizzi — contribute to the $ARGENTO_GEL dial's sonic parameter?
4. How does the synthesizer score (Carpenter, Tangerine Dream, Carlos) produce dread through electronic timbre's occupation of the mechanical-organic boundary?
5. What is the formal relationship between sound design and horror in the Lynch/Splet/Hurley tradition?
6. How does diegetic sound function as a conditioned-response trigger, and what makes diegetic sound weapons more potent than non-diegetic score?
7. What sonic vocabulary does digital audio's failure mode provide, and how does it constitute PHANTASMATA's native sound language?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. The Classical Horror Score (1960–1975)

#### Herrmann's Psycho: The Stabbing Motif as Conditioned Response

Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho (1960) is the foundational text of modern horror scoring. Hitchcock planned the shower scene without music. Herrmann scored it with shrieking high-register violin glissandi replicating the physical action of the stabbing — short downward strokes at frequencies activating the startle reflex. Scored exclusively for strings, the monochromatic palette creates sonic claustrophobia mirroring the film's visual claustrophobia. The shower-scene cue deploys string clusters — multiple instruments playing adjacent semitones, producing a mass of sound the ear cannot resolve. The cluster activates the same neurological response as a scream: a burst of spectrally complex, high-frequency sound that the nervous system interprets as alarm signal.

After Psycho, the high-register string shriek became horror's auditory shorthand. Its effectiveness has not diminished because the startle reflex is involuntary — no genre literacy can suppress it.

For PHANTASMATA: sound can perform what the image cannot show. In lo-fi found-digital formats where visual effects would betray the documentary premise, sound carries the horror.

#### Penderecki: The Avant-Garde as Ready-Made Horror

Penderecki composed orchestral works exploring extended techniques and the boundaries of timbre — Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960), Polymorphia (1961), De Natura Sonoris (1966). His music was appropriated by horror so extensively that his name is now more associated with The Exorcist and The Shining than the concert hall.

Friedkin used Polymorphia in The Exorcist (1973), where the compositions' timbral violence amplifies demonic manifestations. The sounds refuse categorization — are they instruments or screaming voices? — mapping onto the film's thematic ambiguity between psychiatric illness and possession.

Kubrick's deployment in The Shining (1980) is more radical: Penderecki's tone clusters become the Overlook Hotel's ambient sound, indistinguishable from the building's acoustic signature. The hotel itself seems to produce the dissonance — not accompaniment from outside the diegesis but emanation from within the architecture.

The principle PHANTASMATA inherits: avant-garde music is ready-made horror material. Extended techniques produce sounds the auditory system processes as threat signals — the boundaries of instrumental sound map onto the boundaries of the ear's comfort zone.

#### Jerry Goldsmith: The Religious Terror Score

Jerry Goldsmith's contributions to horror scoring — The Omen (1976), Alien (1979), Poltergeist (1982) — demonstrate a different deployment of orchestral dissonance: scoring as ritual. The Omen's "Ave Satani" deploys choral Latin text, liturgical rhythmic structures, and the sonic grammar of sacred music to produce a Black Mass as film score. The horror is not in the dissonance but in the inversion — the audience recognizes the form (hymn, chant, liturgical call-and-response) and recognizes that the content has been reversed. The formal container is sacred; the content is profane. This produces a specific category of dread: not the startle response of Herrmann's stinger but the slow, creeping recognition that the sacred has been colonized.

Goldsmith's Alien score operates differently. The extended opening — sustained ethereal choral texture over slow string oscillation — produces a sense of cosmic emptiness, of sound in a vacuum (physically impossible but psychologically precise). The score tells the audience, before a single alien appears, that they are in a space where human frameworks do not apply. The horror is spatial: the score renders the sound of being far from everything familiar. When the alien manifests, Goldsmith deploys shrill extended-technique strings, but the score's most effective passage is the early, quiet section — the void made audible.

Gyorgy Ligeti's compositions deserve note alongside Penderecki. Kubrick used Ligeti's Atmospheres (1961), Lontano (1967), and Requiem (1965) in 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. Ligeti's technique of micropolyphony — many independent voices moving in slightly different rhythms and pitches, producing a shimmering, shifting mass — renders cosmic scale acoustically. Where Penderecki's clusters are aggressive, Ligeti's textures are enveloping. The sound seems to come from everywhere and nowhere, without attack or decay, as if the universe itself were vibrating. This spatial quality — sound without locatable source — feeds directly into the Voice from Nowhere technique and the $LYNCH_DRIFT dial's treatment of ambient sound as supernatural presence.

### B2. The Italian Connection: Prog-Rock as Horror, Music as Assault

#### Goblin: The Pavlovian Score

Goblin transformed horror scoring by treating the film not as dramatic narrative requiring emotional support but as sensory event requiring amplification. Their scores for Argento — Profondo Rosso (1975), Suspiria (1977), Tenebrae (1982) — anchor the $ARGENTO_GEL dial's sonic signature.

Profondo Rosso's main theme layers a childlike music-box melody over a hammered keyboard riff closer to Keith Emerson than any film-scoring tradition. The music-box signifies innocence; the prog-rock instrumentation signifies kinetic threat. The listener oscillates between false comfort and aggression — contextual dissonance rather than harmonic dissonance.

Suspiria's score deploys a synthesizer melody that cycles without resolving, layered with whispering voices and bass functioning as physical pressure rather than musical note. The "Witch" vocal operates simultaneously as diegetic and non-diegetic — are the witches producing this sound within the narrative? Argento's broader strategy of collapsing the boundary between world and apparatus, rendered sonically.

The Goblin principle for $ARGENTO_GEL: the score creates Pavlovian association. After Suspiria, the theme triggers involuntary anxiety independent of visual stimulus. Goblin's scores are melodically distinctive and repetitive — they implant themselves through rhythmic insistence, and the memory carries the emotional charge. The earworm as horror delivery system.

#### Morricone's Giallo Scores: Counterpoint as Cruelty

Morricone's giallo work — The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970), The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971) — operates on a different principle. Morricone scores murder as beauty. His themes are gorgeous — lush, romantically orchestrated — and their beauty is the horror's instrument. A murder accompanied by a children's choir. The counterpoint between visible violence and audible beauty produces specific cruelty: the music aestheticizes the killing and implicates the listener in that pleasure.

This constitutes a formal argument the $GIALLO axis inherits directly: murder possesses an aesthetic dimension that honest engagement must acknowledge. Morricone's scores are its theoretical justification.

#### Fabio Frizzi: The Pulp Sublime

Frizzi works through what might be called the pulp sublime — synthesizer and guitar textures that are cheap, earnest, and transcendent. His scores for The Beyond (1981) and City of the Living Dead (1980) use limited electronic resources to produce unexpected emotional complexity. The Beyond's mournful synthesizer melody grants Fulci's Grand Guignol excess a dimension of spiritual anguish — these images are not exploitation spectacle but eschatological events, deserving liturgical accompaniment.

For PHANTASMATA: the Frizzi model offers lo-fi scoring directly compatible with found-digital production. Limited electronic resources. Earnest melodic content. Budget constraints as aesthetic feature.

### B3. Synthesizer Horror: The Electronic Uncanny

#### John Carpenter: The Self-Scored Film

Carpenter's self-composed scores — Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Prince of Darkness (1987) — carry a signature sound: sparse synthesizer melodies, repetitive patterns, and timbral palette occupying the band between mechanical and organic.

Halloween's main theme: a 5/4 time-signature piano figure endlessly cycling. The 5/4 meter produces perpetual rhythmic incompletion — the body's instincts are calibrated to even-number meters, and the pattern never resolves. This micro-level frustration accumulates into macro-level dread. The theme performs the experience of being stalked by something whose rhythmic logic is not human.

The Fog renders environment as acoustic space — the drone is the fog's sound, the reverb its spatial distortion. Prince of Darkness pushes into pure ambient dread: long synthesizer drones producing a sensation of stasis simultaneously empty and full — evil as a frequency, a standing wave, a vibration that was here before humans.

The Carpenter model established the synthesizer score as horror's most accessible format — a single person with a synthesizer could produce a complete horror soundscape. This accessibility was not merely economic but aesthetic: the synthesizer's electronic timbre occupies the uncanny valley between organic and mechanical. The sounds are not natural, not entirely artificial — synthesizer designers model their timbres on acoustic instruments, organic processes, environmental phenomena. The result is a class of sounds the ear processes as almost-natural, almost-mechanical, almost-voice, almost-machine. This "almost" is the electronic uncanny, and it is the synthesizer horror score's primary resource.

#### Tangerine Dream and Wendy Carlos: Electronic Environments

Tangerine Dream's horror scoring — Sorcerer (1977, technically thriller), The Keep (1983), Near Dark (1987) — extends the synthesizer score from Carpenter's spare minimalism into textural maximalism. Sequencer-driven compositions produce dense, evolving electronic landscapes simultaneously propulsive and dreamlike — the sequencer's mechanical repetition creates forward motion while synthesizer textures create ambiguity about whether the space is technological or organic, terrestrial or alien. Near Dark's score for Kathryn Bigelow's vampire film provides the most PHANTASMATA-relevant model: electronics producing sound that is both contemporary (sequencer, drum machine) and ancient (drone, modal melody), mapping the vampire's temporal condition — archaic entity moving through modern world.

Wendy Carlos's electronic scores for Kubrick — A Clockwork Orange (1971) and The Shining (1980) — pioneer the electronic rendering of classical forms. Carlos's synthesizer arrangement of Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary takes a baroque funeral march and translates it into electronic timbre, producing sound simultaneously historical and futuristic, human and mechanical. For The Shining, Carlos and Rachel Elkind composed "Rocky Mountains," a synthesizer piece whose oscillating drones and pitch-shifted vocal textures establish the Overlook Hotel's sonic signature before any supernatural event occurs — not the creaking of a physical structure but the electromagnetic hum of a space alive with accumulated psychic residue.

For PHANTASMATA: the synthesizer tradition provides both production method (single person with affordable instruments producing complete horror soundscapes) and timbral philosophy (electronic uncanniness as resource, not limitation). Found-digital outputs scored with simple synthesizer textures inherit Carpenter's lo-fi dread engine. The electronic sound's "cheapness" reads as authenticity in found-digital context: this was made by whoever made this recording, with whatever equipment they had, and the limitation is the texture's guarantee of reality.

### B4. Sound Design as Primary Horror: The Lynch/Splet/Hurley Tradition

#### Eraserhead: The Definitive Achievement

Alan Splet's sound design for Eraserhead (1977) demonstrated definitively that sound design could be a film's primary horror mechanism. Splet constructed the soundscape from industrial recordings, manipulated organic sounds, and synthesized drones — an acoustic environment constituting a world, not a soundtrack accompanying one.

The Industrial Planet Soundscape — dense, layered drone of machinery, wind, and indeterminate organic process saturating every scene — is the film's primary content. The sound tells the audience what images cannot: the environment is alive, pursuing its own agenda. Splet recorded industrial environments and processed them through tape manipulation — slowing, reversing, layering, filtering. He processed organic sounds into textures hovering at the boundary of recognition. The audience almost identifies the source, and the "almost" is the dread.

Three principles the Lynch oeuvre inherits. First: every space has a sound communicating its psychological condition — room tone carries information about what has happened and what the room wants. Second: the boundary between music and sound design is false — the radiator song, industrial drones, baby's cries, and silence are a single composition. Third: silence is not the absence of sound but the presence of listening — when the drone drops out, the audience hears their own nervous system.

#### Dean Hurley and Twin Peaks: The Return

Dean Hurley, Lynch's sound supervisor from Inland Empire (2006) through Twin Peaks: The Return (2017), extended Splet's principles into the digital era. The Return's sound design is the most ambitious horror soundscape in television history — eighteen hours of sonic architecture in which every scene is embedded in a layered ambient environment communicating psychological and supernatural states independently of dialogue, music, and narrative.

The Roadhouse scenes exemplify Hurley's method. Each musical performance is preceded and followed by the bar's ambient texture: crowd murmur, glass clinking, amplifier hum, the specific room tone of a large space with hard surfaces. This ambient layer is not verisimilitude but design — Hurley shapes the room tone to carry emotional content, raising or lowering specific frequencies to produce comfort or unease before the audience consciously registers the shift. The technique is invisible: the audience feels the shift without hearing it, and the feeling arrives before the conscious assessment.

The Red Room scenes deploy even more radical sound design: a sustained, low-frequency drone felt as much as heard — the body vibrates in response to frequencies near the threshold of audibility. This sub-bass presence is the Red Room's sonic signature, communicating the space's ontological status (between worlds, outside time) through physical sensation rather than narrative exposition. The audience's body knows it is in a wrong place before the mind processes the curtains, the zigzag floor, the backward-speaking inhabitants.

Hurley's most PHANTASMATA-relevant innovation is the treatment of electrical hum as supernatural signal. Throughout The Return, the hum of electrical infrastructure — power lines, transformers, light fixtures — operates as a communication channel for the lodge entities. The sound is diegetic (electrical equipment does hum), but its modulation, intensity, and timing are designed to suggest intentionality — as if the electrical grid were speaking and the message were not meant for human ears. This technique maps directly onto PHANTASMATA's found-digital vocabulary: the hum of a phone's microphone, the electronic whine of a laptop's hard drive, the background noise of a video call are all available as signals from within the device — sounds naturalistically explainable and supernaturally suggestive simultaneously. Dual causality at the level of ambient infrastructure.

#### The Physics of Dread: Infrasound and the 19Hz Problem

The scientific foundation for sound-as-dread is measurable. Infrasound — sound below the conventional threshold of human hearing (approximately 20Hz) — produces documented physiological effects: anxiety, unease, the sensation of a presence, blurred vision, cold chills. Vic Tandy's 1998 paper "The Ghost in the Machine" documented a case in which a 19Hz standing wave, produced by a newly installed industrial fan, caused laboratory workers to report feelings of dread, peripheral visual disturbances, and the sensation of being watched. When Tandy identified and eliminated the standing wave, the "hauntings" ceased.

The 19Hz frequency is significant because it approximates the resonant frequency of the human eyeball. At sufficient amplitude, a 19Hz standing wave causes the eyeball to vibrate, producing optical disturbances — smearing at the periphery of vision that the brain interprets as movement. The "presence" people report in infrasound environments is, in part, a visual artifact: they are literally seeing things because their eyeballs are vibrating. This physiological mechanism explains the persistent cross-cultural association between low-frequency sound (thunder, earthquake rumble, large-animal vocalization) and the presence of invisible entities.

Horror cinema has deployed infrasound both deliberately and accidentally. Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002) uses a 28Hz tone throughout the first thirty minutes, producing documented audience distress including nausea and disorientation. Paranormal Activity's sound design includes sub-bass frequencies during the nighttime surveillance sequences, producing the uneasy sense that something is present even when the image shows nothing. The technique is most effective in theatrical environments with large subwoofer systems.

For PHANTASMATA: true infrasound is largely unavailable in found-digital formats, typically consumed through headphones or phone speakers incapable of reproducing sub-20Hz frequencies. But the principle is extractable: the listener's body responds to low-frequency content even when the precise infrasound threshold is not reached. Audio-logs with sustained content in the 30-60Hz range, reproducible by consumer headphones, produce attenuated versions of the effect. The technique's power is proportional to bass response — the same audio-log produces different dread levels on different devices, an asymmetry PHANTASMATA can exploit by designing audio uncomfortable on good headphones and merely uneasy on phone speakers.

### B5. Modern Horror Scoring: The Stripped Score

#### Mica Levi: The Detuned Universe

Levi's Under the Skin (2013) score is built from detuned strings — instruments tuned to non-standard pitches producing intervals the ear cannot place. Not dissonance in the Penderecki sense (standard pitches clashing) but a tonal universe where basic intervals are wrong. The ear reaches for familiar harmony and finds it displaced by fractions of a semitone — recognition-and-wrongness mapping onto the film's alien entity almost passing as human. Extended techniques (excessive bow pressure, bowing behind the bridge, col legno) make instruments sound like themselves and not-themselves. The seduction theme's descending three-note detuned figure produces attraction and dread simultaneously — desire-and-fear as single sonic experience, the $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS axis made audible.

#### Colin Stetson: The Body as Instrument

Stetson's Hereditary (2018) score pushes the music/sound-design dissolution to its limit. His bass saxophone performance technique — circular breathing, multiphonics, key clicks, vocalizing through the instrument — produces sounds unrecognizable as any conventional instrument. The saxophone becomes an organic machine: breathing, groaning, clicking apparatus producing tones, drones, and rhythms simultaneously. The sound is of a body in distress — too large, too resonant, too mechanically precise to be human.

Charlie's diegetic tongue click — the film's most famous auditory signature — finds its non-diegetic counterpart in Stetson's key clicks. Score and diegesis share a sonic vocabulary; the boundary dissolves.

For PHANTASMATA: the human body itself is a horror instrument. Audio-logs foregrounding breathing, swallowing, and physical movements carry inherent dread — consciousness housed in meat, made audible.

#### Disasterpeace: Corruption of the Pleasant

Disasterpeace's It Follows (2014) score deploys a throbbing bass pulse at cardiac rhythm, slightly too fast, beneath high-frequency noise and atonal stabs. The listener's heartbeat entrains to the score's pulse rate (approximately 90-100 BPM, above resting), producing subtle physiological elevation.

The score's PHANTASMATA-relevant technique: several passages begin with warm, consonant synthesizer chords — 1980s nostalgia — then degrade: detuning, hardening timbre, accumulating noise. The pleasant sound transforms into its own distressed version. This corruption maps onto found-digital material that begins normal and becomes wrong.

#### Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross: The Anxiety Texture

Reznor/Ross (Gone Girl, 2014) developed the anxiety texture: processed electronic sounds and layered drones producing persistent low-level unease. The innovation is temporal — conventional scoring alternates tension and release; Reznor/Ross eliminate release. The anxiety is constant, inescapable. Gone Girl's score sounds like comfort and feels like threat: the warmth is the cruelty. Surface pleasant, substrate not — a principle PHANTASMATA inherits directly.

### B6. The Diegetic Sound Weapon

#### The Conditioned-Response Cue

The most potent horror sounds are diegetic — they originate within the narrative world. Charlie's tongue click in Hereditary. The telephone ring in Ringu. The lullaby in Deep Red. The breathing in Black Christmas (1974). These persist beyond the film: the audience hears a tongue click in real life and the conditioned anxiety fires. Diegetic sound weapons colonize the audience's real-world acoustic environment.

The mechanism is classical conditioning, more potent than laboratory conditioning because the sounds are drawn from everyday life — a click, a ring, a lullaby. The filmmaker selects sounds the audience will inevitably encounter, guaranteeing repeated exposure and preventing extinction.

Deep Red provides the $ARGENTO_GEL dial's definitive diegetic weapon. The lullaby — simple, childlike, diegetic — accompanies the original murder. Conditioned across the runtime to signify approaching violence, its childlike simplicity makes the conditioning more potent because the sound itself is associated with safety. The safe sound signals danger. The inversion is the weapon.

#### The VHS Tracking Noise and Analog Horror

Analog horror (Local 58, The Backrooms, The Mandela Catalogue) has elevated media decay sounds to primary horror mechanism: VHS tracking noise, tape hiss, VCR mechanical clunk. These signify the condition under which horror is being preserved — the medium's deterioration, its entropy toward noise.

The horror function is temporal. Tracking noise tells the audience what they watch is old — recorded, stored, degraded. The medium's failure is the sound of time passing, and what was recorded long ago has been waiting for this moment of review.

For PHANTASMATA: digital equivalents are compression artifacts, buffering silence, codec errors, and connectivity failure sounds (dropped-call silence, VoIP warbling). These function identically to analog predecessors: the medium's failure implies what is being transmitted exceeds its capacity to contain it.

#### The Notification Ping as Horror Trigger

The notification sound — ping, buzz, chime — is Pavlovian through thousands of daily repetitions conditioning anticipatory arousal. Horror hijacks this: the ping meaning "someone wants to talk to you" becomes "something is contacting you."

Host (2020) deploys Zoom's familiar audio cues — connection chimes, chat notifications, microphone alerts — as horror elements. The chime meaning a friend has connected now means something else has entered the call.

For PHANTASMATA: a mock-post arriving on the audience's actual device produces a real notification sound. If the content is unsettling, the notification becomes retroactively conditioned. The found-digital format does not merely represent the notification; it produces a real one. The diegetic and the real collapse.

### B7. Audio Horror as Standalone Form

Audio horror — horror delivered through sound alone, without accompanying imagery — exploits the most powerful mechanism available: the listener's own imagination. The image the mind constructs in response to a verbal description or suggestive sound is always worse than any produced image, because the imagined image is calibrated precisely to the individual listener's specific fear architecture. A film shows a monster and the audience evaluates it against expectations — scarier than expected, less scary, the wrong shape. An audio description suggests a monster and each listener constructs their own, from their own repository of fear, and the result is a monster designed by the one intelligence best equipped to frighten them: their own.

#### The Podcast as Horror Form

The Magnus Archives (2016-2021) is the podcast form's most accomplished horror text. Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, reads statements documenting encounters with supernatural entities organized by a taxonomy of fear — The Buried (claustrophobia), The Vast (agoraphobia), The Stranger (the uncanny), The Spiral (madness), The Slaughter (violence), The Web (manipulation). Each statement is a first-person account read in a quiet room with minimal sound design (tape recorder click, ambient room noise, occasional distant sounds). The format's power derives from restraint: the listener constructs every environment, every entity, every moment of horror from the narrator's voice and their own imagination. The Magnus Archives' taxonomy of fear is itself a sound-design principle — each fear domain has a distinctive sonic signature (The Buried sounds close and muffled; The Vast sounds empty and echoing; The Stranger sounds almost-right) deployed with minimal but precise effect.

Welcome to Night Vale (2012-present) operates differently, using the format of a community radio broadcast to deliver surreal horror through the gap between the announcer's calm, matter-of-fact delivery and the content of his announcements. The horror is in the register mismatch — the sound of normalcy (a radio broadcast, a familiar format, a pleasant voice) containing information that is not normal. This is the audio equivalent of Morricone's counterpoint technique: the sound says "everything is fine" while the content says "everything is wrong."

The Black Tapes (2015-2017) deploys the investigative-documentary format — a journalist investigating paranormal phenomena through interviews, archival recordings, and field recordings. The format inherits the epistemic power of found-footage documentary (Brief 01) translated into pure audio: each recording is presented as a genuine document, and the gradual accumulation of evidence produces the archival horror that Noroi achieves in visual found footage. The listener assembles the picture from fragments, and the picture is worse than any single fragment because the listener's pattern-recognition fills the gaps with threat.

#### ASMR Horror: Intimacy as Weapon

ASMR horror represents the form's most intimate expression. Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response — the tingling sensation produced by specific auditory triggers (whispering, tapping, scratching, close-microphone breathing) — is a physiological response to sounds associated with proximity, care, and attention. ASMR horror inverts this by deploying the same trigger sounds in contexts of threat. The listener's body produces the ASMR response (tingling, relaxation) while the content produces anxiety, and the conflict between physiological comfort and cognitive threat creates a unique form of horror: the body says "safe" while the mind says "danger," and the dissociation between the two is the dread.

The technique exploits the microphone's intimacy. Close-microphone recording captures sounds inaudible at normal distance — the moistness of lip movement, the click of the tongue against the palate, the rush of breath through nostrils, the micro-swallowing that punctuates speech. These are sounds the listener normally hears only from people close enough to harm them or help them — a lover, a parent, a predator. The close-mic recording collapses the physical distance that normally separates speaker and listener, producing a false proximity that ASMR horror fills with threat.

For PHANTASMATA: the audio-log as primary vehicle. Pure sound, presented as recording, inviting the listener to construct the visual from acoustic evidence. The audio-log that records ambiguous sounds in a space the listener must imagine. The audio-log where the microphone picks up something the speaker does not acknowledge. The audio-log that is too close — ASMR proximity, whispering, the speaker's body audible — and the intimacy is the threat.

### B8. The Digital Sound Vocabulary: PHANTASMATA's Native Tongue

#### Compression Artifacts as Horror

Digital audio's compression algorithms (MP3, AAC, Opus, Vorbis) achieve file-size reduction by discarding audio information the algorithm's psychoacoustic model predicts the listener will not notice. At low bitrates, the discarding becomes audible: the audio acquires a characteristic "underwater" quality, high frequencies lose definition, transient sounds (clicks, percussive attacks) produce pre-echo artifacts, and complex spectral content degrades into a chirping, warbling distortion that sounds organic and mechanical simultaneously.

This degradation has a specific horror function: it makes familiar sounds uncanny. A voice compressed at a sufficiently low bitrate sounds human but wrong — the formant structure is preserved (you recognize it as a voice) but the spectral detail is lost (you cannot be certain it is the voice you expect). Low-bitrate voice compression produces a digital equivalent of the uncanny valley: close enough to human to be recognized as such, far enough from human to trigger unease.

For PHANTASMATA: audio-logs and video-logs with deliberately degraded audio — low bitrate, lossy compression, reduced sample rate — produce inherent unease that is naturalistically explainable (poor recording conditions, cheap equipment, low-bandwidth upload) and supernaturally suggestive (the voice sounds wrong because the recording is bad, or the voice sounds wrong because the speaker is not what they appear to be). Dual causality at the level of audio fidelity.

#### The Sound of a Bad Connection

Telecommunications failure has a specific sonic vocabulary: the dead silence of a dropped call (not quiet, not ambient silence, but the absolute silence of a terminated audio stream — a silence that sounds different from any other silence because it is the silence of disconnection rather than the silence of a quiet room). The robotic warbling of a degrading VoIP connection. The echo and delay of a satellite phone call. The crackle and pop of a cellular connection losing signal. The one-sided conversation when audio drops in one direction but not the other.

These sounds are horror resources because they signify the failure of connection at the moment connection is most needed. The phone call drops during the crucial revelation. The VoIP connection degrades when the speaker is trying to warn you. The satellite delay means you hear words from seconds ago, and in those seconds, things have changed. Telecommunications failure sounds are the sounds of isolation becoming total — the channel closing, the voice disappearing, the you who was not alone becoming the you who is.

Skinamarink (2022, Kyle Edward Ball) builds its entire sonic architecture from the sounds of a deteriorating domestic environment: television static, VHS playback, the hum of a house at night, distant and indistinct voices, sounds that might be footsteps or might be the house settling. The film strips audio to its most fundamental components — environmental hum, distant sound, silence — and lets the listener's pattern-recognition assign meaning to noise. The sounds are never identified; the source is never shown. The audience hears what they are afraid to hear.

#### Voice Synthesis and the AI Uncanny

The most contemporary addition to digital sound's horror vocabulary is the AI-generated voice. Text-to-speech systems, voice cloning, and neural voice synthesis produce speech that is almost human — the prosody is correct, the timbre is plausible, but something is wrong. The wrongness is difficult to identify precisely: the voice is too smooth, too consistent, lacking the micro-variations (breath noise, vocal fry, pitch instability) that characterize biological speech production. The AI voice occupies the auditory uncanny valley: close enough to human to parse as speech, far enough to produce unease.

Voice cloning — reproducing a specific person's voice from a small sample of recorded speech — adds a layer of horror specific to the contemporary moment: the voice of someone you know, saying things they did not say. A parent's voice delivering a message the parent did not record. A dead person's voice speaking in the present tense. The voice is correct — it sounds like them — but the content is wrong, and the gap between the voice's familiarity and the content's wrongness is the dread.

For PHANTASMATA: the AI voice is a found-digital horror resource deployed within the project's constraint — "No AI elements in creative identity (AI assists process, not product)." The constraint does not prohibit depiction of AI voices within outputs — an audio-log in which a character receives a message in a cloned voice, a video-log in which a text-to-speech system reads something it should not know — but prohibits using AI-generated voices as the creative product's own voice. The AI voice is diegetic content, not production method.

## C) Techniques Inventory

Twenty formal techniques, each assessed for PHANTASMATA application.

---

**01: The Stinger.** Sudden burst of high-frequency, spectrally complex sound at high volume timed to visual shock, activating the involuntary startle reflex. *Horror function:* Bypasses cognition; the body reacts before comprehension. Effective regardless of genre literacy. *Examples:* Psycho's shower strings, Insidious franchise jump scares, The Exorcist III hospital corridor. *Format affinity:* Video-log, audio-log.

**02: The Conditioned-Response Cue.** Specific distinctive diegetic sound paired with horror events until the sound alone produces anxiety. Must be simple, memorable, and drawn from everyday acoustic environment. *Horror function:* Extends horror beyond the work into the audience's daily life. *Examples:* Hereditary's tongue click, Ringu's phone ring, Deep Red's lullaby, Black Christmas breathing. *Format affinity:* All audio-carrying formats.

**03: The Industrial Drone.** Sustained low-frequency sound persisting beneath dialogue, saturating the sonic environment with continuous threat. Does not respond to narrative events. *Horror function:* Eliminates tension-release cycle. Dread becomes ambient, inescapable. *Examples:* Eraserhead, Prince of Darkness, Twin Peaks: The Return Red Room. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (atmosphere), video-log (environment).

**04: Silence-as-Presence.** Deliberate removal of all sound including room tone, producing a void the ear interprets as unnatural — something has silenced the environment. *Horror function:* Activates primal predator-detection response. Environmental silence signals a predator's presence. *Examples:* Lynch throughout Mulholland Drive, the silence before Pulse's ghost approach, A Quiet Place. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (most powerful tool), video-log (silence where sound should be).

**05: The Detuned String.** Instruments tuned to non-standard pitches producing intervals approximating but not matching expected tones. Near-rightness creates uncanniness full atonality cannot. *Horror function:* Sonic uncanny valley — recognition-and-wrongness as indivisible sensation. *Examples:* Under the Skin, Penderecki's Threnody, Jonny Greenwood scores. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (ambient texture), video-log (background scoring).

**06: The Pavlovian Score.** Melodically distinctive, highly repetitive score implanting itself through cyclic insistence. Must function as earworm carrying dread. *Horror function:* Involuntary recall reactivates horror association. The score infects the listener's internal soundtrack. *Examples:* Goblin's Profondo Rosso theme, Halloween theme, Tubular Bells, Suspiria theme. *Format affinity:* All audio-carrying formats; recurring fragment across outputs.

**07: The Room Tone Shift.** Manipulation of a space's ambient sound — specific frequency changes — signaling psychological or supernatural shift without visible change. *Horror function:* Pre-conscious unease; the audience feels wrongness before identifying it. *Examples:* Hurley's Twin Peaks work, Hereditary's attic scenes, The Shining's Overlook Hotel. *Format affinity:* Video-log (shifts between takes), audio-log (environment changes mid-recording).

**08: The Lullaby Corruption.** Simple, childlike melody associated with innocence deployed in contexts of violence or supernatural dread. *Horror function:* The safe sound made dangerous corrupts the concept of safety itself. *Examples:* Deep Red, Profondo Rosso music box, "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" in Insidious, Rosemary's Baby. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (lullaby in wrong context), video-log (lullaby in empty space).

**09: The Voice from Nowhere.** Human voice whose source cannot be located within acoustic space — present but unplaceable, emanating from no identifiable direction. *Horror function:* Violates the auditory system's basic sound-localization function. Fundamental perceptual failure produces dread. *Examples:* Suspiria whispers, Eraserhead radiator song, BOB in Twin Peaks, EVP recordings. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (voice on recording not heard during capture), video-log (voice with no visible source).

**10: The Lo-Fi Recording Artifact.** Characteristic sounds of consumer-grade equipment — tape hiss, handling noise, wind on unshielded mic, AGC whine. Signify amateur conditions and by extension authenticity. *Horror function:* Authenticity markers making content credible as document, therefore more frightening as horror. *Examples:* Blair Witch throughout, analog horror VHS texture, phone-quality audio. *Format affinity:* All formats. Outputs should sound recorded, not produced.

**11: The Infrasound Presence.** Low-frequency content (20-40Hz for reproducibility, sub-20Hz for maximum) at amplitude producing physiological responses: unease, sensation of being watched, chest pressure. *Horror function:* Direct somatic dread bypassing auditory processing. *Examples:* Paranormal Activity sub-bass, Irreversible's 28Hz, Hereditary attic scenes. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (headphone consumption), video-log (ambient design).

**12: The Counterpoint Score.** Music of conspicuous beauty set against horror content. Beauty aestheticizes violence, implicating listener in pleasure. *Horror function:* Irreconcilable emotional position — ears receive pleasure, content delivers horror. *Examples:* Morricone's Bird with the Crystal Plumage, A Clockwork Orange classical music, American Psycho's "Hip to Be Square." *Format affinity:* Video-log, audio-log (pleasant voice describing unpleasant things).

**13: The Notification as Trigger.** Real-world digital notification sounds deployed as diegetic horror cues, hijacking pre-existing technology-conditioned responses. *Horror function:* Notification already produces micro-arousal; horror recontextualizes arousal as threat. Post-viewing contamination of audience's real notifications. *Examples:* Host Zoom sounds, Unfriended notifications, One Missed Call ringtone. *Format affinity:* Screen-capture (native), mock-post (produces real notification), video-log.

**14: The Listener's Construction.** Deliberate withholding of visual information, forcing audience to construct horror image from audio evidence and their own imagination. *Horror function:* Outsources horror to audience's mind — no one frightens a person more effectively than themselves. *Examples:* The Magnus Archives, The Haunting (1963), radio drama horror, ASMR horror. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (primary), text-fragment (activates auditory imagination).

**15: The Media-Within-Media Audio.** Sound from a media device depicted within the work — TV in background, phone on speaker, laptop video. Doubly mediated, producing specific degraded texture and ontological uncertainty. *Horror function:* $KON_SPIRAL rendered acoustically. Uncertainty about which reality-layer is producing the sound. *Examples:* Ringu cursed tape audio, Poltergeist TV broadcasts, Sinister video-within-video, One Missed Call recordings. *Format affinity:* Video-log, screen-capture, audio-log (recording of recording).

**16: The Corrupted Playback.** Audio degrading during playback — increasing distortion, pitch drift, dropout. The medium failing to sustain its content. *Horror function:* Content exceeding container's capacity — too old, too cursed, too wrong for the recording to sustain. *Examples:* Analog horror VHS distortion, Session 9 degrading audio, Sinister home movies. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (degrades as it plays), video-log, screen-capture (media player struggling).

**17: The Organic Machine.** Sound occupying the boundary between biological and mechanical — breathing as pump, heartbeat as piston, industrial noise as digestion. *Horror function:* Auditory uncanny valley's deepest point. Sounds resisting living/manufactured classification produce category-violation dread. *Examples:* Eraserhead, Stetson's Hereditary, Alien Xenomorph sounds, Tetsuo: The Iron Man. *Format affinity:* Audio-log, video-log.

**18: The Sonic Trigger Loop.** Short sound repeating at regular intervals creating anticipatory rhythm — the listener dreads each recurrence. Transforms single dread event into ongoing condition. *Horror function:* Each repetition reinforces conditioning while building anticipation. Silence between repetitions fills with expectation. *Examples:* Don't Breathe ticking, Dark Water dripping, Ju-On footsteps, Paranormal Activity nighttime breathing. *Format affinity:* Audio-log, video-log.

**19: The Digital Decay Texture.** Sounds of digital audio failure — compression artifacts, codec errors, bit-rate degradation, buffer underrun clicks. Native to digital environment, analogous to analog tape hiss. *Horror function:* Authenticity markers and horror texture simultaneously. Content passing through real system with real limitations, straining those limitations. *Examples:* Unfriended Skype degradation, Pulse digital distortion, creepypasta audio, Skinamarink. *Format affinity:* All digital formats. PHANTASMATA's native sound vocabulary.

**20: The ASMR Inversion.** Sounds triggering autonomous sensory meridian response (whispering, tapping, close-mic breathing) deployed in threatening contexts. *Horror function:* Body says safe; mind says danger. Conflict between physiological comfort and cognitive threat creates unique horror unavailable to other techniques. *Examples:* ASMR horror content, Suspiria/Twin Peaks whispers, Black Christmas close-mic breathing. *Format affinity:* Audio-log (primary — intimate close-mic sound), video-log.

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### D1. Director Dial Mappings

**$ARGENTO_GEL — Goblin Pavlov, Aggressive Scoring:**
At 0: silence or ambient drone. At 50: the Frizzi register — lo-fi synthesizer melodies of genuine emotion. At 100: full Goblin — prog-rock at concert-volume intensity, Pavlovian earworm at maximum force. Native techniques: Pavlovian Score (06), Lullaby Corruption (08), Conditioned-Response Cue (02), Counterpoint Score (12). Scoring philosophy: music as weapon. The sound attacks, creating not mood but condition.

**$LYNCH_DRIFT — Electrical Hum, Silence, Industrial Texture:**
At 0: naturalistic room tone. At 50: the Hurley register — manipulated room tone, electrical hum carrying emotional weight. At 100: full Eraserhead — industrial drone as total environment, space itself as horror's voice. Native techniques: Silence-as-Presence (04), Industrial Drone (03), Room Tone Shift (07), Organic Machine (17), Voice from Nowhere (09). Scoring philosophy: sound as environment. The listener inhabits the horror rather than hearing it.

**$KON_SPIRAL — Media-Within-Media Audio, Mediation Collapse:**
At 0: clean unmediated audio. At 50: the Ringu register — audio from media device within narrative, doubly mediated. At 100: full Kon — audio whose reality-level cannot be determined, mediation layers so nested the "real" audio is indistinguishable from "reproduced." Native techniques: Media-Within-Media Audio (15), Corrupted Playback (16), Digital Decay Texture (19), Notification as Trigger (13). Scoring philosophy: sound as hall of mirrors — ontological uncertainty about which layer is real.

Digital decay, notification sounds, compression artifacts, bad-connection silence. The medium as horror instrument.

### D3. Format Sonic Profiles

**Video-log:** Full audio — microphone captures environment, voice, diegetic sound. Imperfections are authenticity. Primary: Lo-Fi Artifact (10), Room Tone Shift (07), Conditioned-Response Cue (02).

**Screen-capture:** System audio and optional mic input. Nested audio from browsers, media players, chat apps. Primary: Notification as Trigger (13), Media-Within-Media Audio (15), Digital Decay Texture (19).

**Audio-log:** Pure sound, no visual. Power is the Listener's Construction. Most suited to intimate/ASMR proximity, environmental recording, ambiguous-source recording. Primary: Listener's Construction (14), Silence-as-Presence (04), ASMR Inversion (20), Industrial Drone (03), Voice from Nowhere (09).

**Text-fragment:** No audio, but described sounds activate auditory imagination. "A low hum, just below what you can hear" produces the hum in the reader's inner ear. Primary: Listener's Construction (14), Conditioned-Response Cue (02, referencing sounds from other outputs).

**Mock-post:** Platform-permitted audio plus real notification sound on audience's device. Primary: Notification as Trigger (13, literally), Digital Decay Texture (19).

### D5. Axis Integration

**$GRINDHOUSE:** The grindhouse axis's sonic signature is the sound of the distribution medium itself — VHS tracking noise, tape hiss, the lo-fi quality of exploitation cinema's sound mixes. Grindhouse audio is not poorly recorded by accident but poorly recorded as a condition of its industrial context: low budgets, fast schedules, post-dubbing in Italian cinema, fourth-generation video dubs for rental-market distribution. PHANTASMATA's found-digital equivalent: audio that sounds like it passed through consumer-grade equipment, low-bandwidth networks, and cheap compression. The lo-fi texture is not a failure of production but the medium's authentic voice.

**$GIALLO:** The giallo axis's sonic vocabulary is the richest in the constellation — Goblin, Morricone, Frizzi, Simonetti's solo work, the broader Italian library-music tradition. The giallo sound is maximalist where grindhouse is lo-fi: bold, melodic, rhythmically aggressive, operatic in emotional register. The $GIALLO sound is the $ARGENTO_GEL dial at moderate-to-high settings, where the score is a co-equal participant with the image rather than its servant.

**$LYNCH:** The Lynch axis is this brief's center of gravity. Lynch's cinema is fundamentally sonic — the images are extraordinary, but the sound is what makes them operate as horror. The $LYNCH sound is the $LYNCH_DRIFT dial at high settings: industrial drone, electrical hum, silence-as-presence, room tone as psychological indicator. Lynch's sonic philosophy — that every space has a voice, that the boundary between music and sound design is false, that silence is not absence but intensified presence — is PHANTASMATA's foundational sound principle.

**$FOUND_FOOTAGE:** Found footage's sonic dimension is defined by the diegetic camera's audio capture — everything the microphone records, including what the camera operator did not intend to capture. Handling noise, wind, the operator's breathing, background sounds that become significant on review. The found-footage sound is always "too much" (it captures everything indiscriminately) and "too little" (it captures only what the microphone can reach, missing what happens outside its range). This surplus-and-deficit is the audio-log format's native condition.

**$PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS:** The Perfect Blue register's sonic expression is the sound of unreliable perception — audio that the audience cannot trust. Is this memory or present? Is this the character's voice or their internal monologue? Is the music diegetic (playing in the character's world) or non-diegetic (playing for the audience)? The $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS sound is the audio of a mind that cannot distinguish between what it hears and what it imagines, rendered as found-digital output where the same ambiguity infects the listener.

### D6. Cross-Domain Integration

**Sound and Found Footage (Brief 01):** Every found-footage technique has a sonic dimension. The diegetic camera's audio is always "on" — it captures ambient sound, handling noise, the operator's breathing. Found footage's authenticity depends on audio as much as image: audiences detect a produced-quality soundtrack faster than produced-quality cinematography. PHANTASMATA's found-digital outputs must sound recorded, not produced. The Lo-Fi Recording Artifact (10) is not optional; it is the audio equivalent of the diegetic camera.

**Sound and Giallo (Brief 03):** The giallo ecosystem's sonic vocabulary — Goblin, Morricone, Frizzi, the broader Eurohorror scoring tradition — is the $ARGENTO_GEL dial's library. But the giallo tradition's treatment of sound extends beyond scoring: the diegetic sound weapon (the lullaby in Deep Red, the music box in Profondo Rosso) and the counterpoint technique (beautiful music against violent imagery) are formal innovations that cross all three dials.

**Sound and Dream Cinema (Brief 04):** Dream has a specific sonic signature: the dissolution of spatial acoustics (sounds in dreams do not obey the inverse-square law; a whisper can be louder than a scream), temporal distortion (sounds that slow, loop, reverse), and the collapse of diegetic/non-diegetic distinction (the dreamer cannot distinguish between sounds within the dream and sounds from outside). PHANTASMATA outputs aiming for oneiric register should deploy these sonic dream-markers: audio where spatial acoustics are wrong, where temporal flow is distorted, where the source-reality of sound is ambiguous.

**Sound and Asian Horror (Brief 06):** J-horror's sonic vocabulary — the silence of Nakata's films, the technological ghost's audio dimension (the phone ring in Ringu, the static of the cursed tape), the radical slowness of Kurosawa's soundscapes — feeds the $LYNCH_DRIFT and $KON_SPIRAL dials simultaneously. Asian horror teaches that the absence of sound can be more frightening than any sound, and that technological mediation always carries a sonic signature that can be weaponized. The cursed tape does not merely show cursed images — it produces cursed sound, and the sound persists after the images stop.

### D7. Key Extraction Principles

1. **Sound is horror's fastest channel.** Audio cues reach the amygdala 15-20ms before visual cues. Sound design is horror's advance guard, not its supplement.

2. **Lo-fi texture is resource, not limitation.** Consumer-grade artifacts function as authenticity markers. Polished audio betrays the documentary premise. Outputs should sound like the device that supposedly produced them.

3. **Diegetic weapons persist beyond the work.** A score frightens during viewing; a diegetic cue (click, ring, notification) frightens during viewing and every encounter after. Design cues from the audience's real acoustic environment.

4. **Silence must be designed, not defaulted.** True silence requires ambient noise (room tone, device hum) that drops to nothing. The transition from ambient to void is the horror.

5. **Every device has a voice.** Phone mic hum, laptop fan, speaker idle buzz — include these to collapse the boundary between the audience's device and the recording's device.

6. **The body is always audible.** Breathing, swallowing, heartbeat, clothing rustle — foregrounding body sounds reminds the listener consciousness is housed in a biological system that fails.

7. **Audio mediation nests.** Each recording layer adds artifacts, noise floor, frequency loss. High $KON_SPIRAL produces audio whose layer count is uncertain — the uncertainty is the ontological vertigo.
