## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. Francisco Goya: The Sleep of Reason
*   **The Engine:** The Black Paintings. Horror as the release of the "Monster" within the human psyche when rational control fails (*Saturn Devouring His Son*, *The Witches' Sabbath*).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *Visceral Rawness:* Broad, urgent brushstrokes. Darkness that is "Thick."
    *   *The Mouth:* The act of consumption as the ultimate horror.
    *   *The Crowd:* A mob of distorted, screaming faces.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Shadow is the Source.* Darkness is not the absence of light; it is the truth that light conceals.

### B. G.B. Piranesi: The Psychological Prison
*   **The Engine:** The Imaginary Prisons. The underworld as a vast, non-Euclidean architecture of the mind where one is simultaneously the jailer and the prisoner.
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *Infinite Perspective:* Hallways and arches that lead nowhere.
    *   *The Machine:* Torture devices that appear to be part of the building's architecture.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Mind is an Enclosure.* The deeper you go, the more you realize there is no exit.

### C. Mary Shelley: The Technological Abomination
*   **The Engine:** The Modern Prometheus. Horror as the "Unintended Consequence" of creation. The creature as a mirror of its creator's hubris (*Frankenstein*).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *The Assemblage:* Life built from fragments of the dead.
    *   *The Arctic Void:* Blinding white isolation as the landscape of despair.
*   **Epistemology:** *Creation is Abandonment.* The horror is not that we made it, but that we left it alone.

### D. Edgar Allan Poe: The Premature Burial
*   **The Engine:** The Perverse Impulse. The compulsion to do the very thing that will destroy you. The terror of being "Trapped while Alive" (*The Fall of the House of Usher*, *The Tell-Tale Heart*).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *The Beat:* The sound of a heart (or clock) that won't stop.
    *   *The Decay:* Architecture that crumbles in sync with the occupant's mind.
    *   *The Double:* The doppelganger as the harbinger of death.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Truth is Beneath the Floorboards.* The more you hide it, the louder it speaks.

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE INTERIOR ABYSS PROTOCOL"

**Axiom:** The ruin is you.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Perversion:** The protagonist is compelled to open a "Forbidden" file or enter a "Locked" room.
2.  **The Assembly:** The protagonist finds evidence of themselves being "Reconstructed" by the system.
3.  **The Ticking:** A rhythmic, industrial sound begins to dominate the environment (The Poe Beat).
4.  **The Collapse:** The physical space (The Apartment) dissolves, revealing the vast, Piranesian void within the user's own chest.

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Ring 3 (Deep Drift):** Use Poe's "Decay" logic—the text of the fragments should literally "Crumble" (Unicode glitches) as the story progresses.
*   **Ring 1 (The Bleed):** Apply Goya's "Black Paintings" palette—crushed blacks and muddy indigos.
*   **Episode 08:** The protagonist should encounter a "Shelley-esque" assemblage of their own social media data.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Fragment: "The Tell-Tale App"
*Context: A user is trying to delete their browser history.*

The user selects "Clear All Time." 
The screen displays a Goya-style image of a man eating his own mouse. 
The user clicks [CONFIRM]. 
The sound of a hard drive spinning begins. It matches the user's pulse. 
Every time the drive clicks, a letter of the user's search history appears on their physical wall in charcoal. 
The user tries to paint over the words. 
The paint is wet. It smells like copper. 
The words are still there, beating beneath the surface. **"I SAW YOU."**

## Part 5: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** Max $LYNCH_DRIFT (Psychological) + Max $GRINDHOUSE (Decay).
*   **Primary Effect:** Claustrophobic Guilt.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes the "Interior Abyss" as the law of Ring 3.
