## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. Dante Alighieri: The Moral Cartography
*   **The Engine:** The Nine Circles. The underworld is an inverted cone, a perfectly ordered system of classification where the punishment mirrors the sin (*The Divine Comedy*).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *The Inscription:* "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." (The static warning).
    *   *The Spiral:* The vertical descent through specific, themed rings.
    *   *Contrapasso:* The logic of ironic, symbolic repetition.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Universe has a Grammar.* Evil is not chaotic; it is a rigid structure that can be mapped.

### B. Hieronymus Bosch: The Surreal Menagerie
*   **The Engine:** The Garden of Torment. The underworld is a landscape of biological and mechanical mutation where the everyday becomes an instrument of pain (*The Garden of Earthly Delights*).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *Hybrid Bodies:* Creatures made of musical instruments, birds, and human limbs.
    *   *The Giant Ear:* Surveillance as a physical, auditory organ.
    *   *The Detail Overload:* Thousands of simultaneous atrocities in a single frame.
*   **Epistemology:** *Sin is a Mutation.* The subconscious desires manifest as physical deformations.

### C. John Milton: The Majestic Ruin
*   **The Engine:** Pandemonium. The underworld is a high-tech (for its time), grand city built in the void. It is a space of rebellion, pride, and "Darkness Visible" (*Paradise Lost*).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *Architecture of Gold and Fire:* The luxury of the damned.
    *   *The Fallen Angel:* The entity that is "Noble but Broken."
    *   *The Void:* The chaos surrounding the infernal city.
*   **Epistemology:** *Hell is a State of Mind.* "The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven."

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE INFERNAL GRID PROTOCOL"

**Axiom:** The system is just.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Classification:** The protagonist's "Account" is sorted based on its "Data-History."
2.  **The Ironic Loop:** A recurring digital act (scrolling, clicking) becomes a physical ritual.
3.  **The Surveillance Ear:** The protagonist hears the sound of their own thoughts being "Processed" by the building.
4.  **The Grand Architecture:** The realization that the "Apartment" is one room in an infinite, golden Pandemonium.

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Ring 2 (City of Gels):** Use Milton's "Darkness Visible" aesthetic. Light that illuminates nothing but the abyss.
*   **Ring 1 (The Bleed):** Apply Bosch's hybrid logic—objects in the room (the toaster, the router) grow human limbs.
*   **The 12-Week Cycle:** Use Dante's Nine Circles as the structural template for the "Seeding" of the folders.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Fragment: "The Contrapasso"
*Context: A user is stuck in a loop of 'Liking' posts.*

The user clicks the Heart icon. 
Their own heart skips a beat. 
They click it again. Their heart skips again. 
They try to stop. 
The screen displays a Bosch-style image of a giant finger clicking a human chest. 
A voice (Miltonic tone) says: "Thou hast chosen the pulse of the crowd. Now, thou shalt provide it."
The mouse cursor becomes a needle that enters the user's skin. 
Every 'Like' on the screen now pumps a drop of the user's blood into the Ethernet cable.

## Part 5: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** Max $ARGENTO_GEL (Grandeur) + High $GRINDHOUSE (Visceral Mutation).
*   **Primary Effect:** Systematic Dread.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes the "Infernal Grid" as the governance model for Ring 2.
