## A) Topic Definition and Scope

Found footage is not a genre. It is an epistemic position — a formal declaration about the relationship between what is shown and who is showing it. Every film communicates through a camera. In conventional cinema, the camera is invisible: it occupies a position no character acknowledges, no physical body holds, no narrative event explains. In found footage, the camera becomes *diegetic* — it exists within the world of the story, is held by a hand that can tremble, powered by a battery that can die, and pointed by an intelligence that can panic, lie, or fail to look at the right thing at the right moment. The transition from invisible camera to diegetic camera is not a stylistic preference. It is a fundamental reorganization of the epistemological contract between the film and its audience. Conventional cinema says: *trust the image; the camera is omniscient*. Found footage says: *distrust the image; the camera is as limited, frightened, and unreliable as the person holding it*.

This brief investigates that reorganization as a forty-year formal trajectory — from Ruggero Deodato's *Cannibal Holocaust* (1980) through the screen-life cinema of Rob Savage's *Host* (2020) and the ongoing mutation of found media into platform-native horror. The scope consolidates two research streams that the PHANTASMATA project treats as a single continuum: *found footage as cinematic form* (the diegetic camera, the mockumentary frame, the first-person horror film) and *the mockumentary continuum* (the spectrum from documentary parody through horror verisimilitude to full ontological collapse). These streams share a common formal problem — the management of the audience's belief state — and a common technical vocabulary — shaky-cam, degraded image, title cards, direct address, the "why are they still filming?" question. They diverge in their relationship to humor (the mockumentary permits comedy; the found-footage horror film generally does not) and in their relationship to institutions (the mockumentary parodies institutional documentation; the found-footage horror film *becomes* institutional documentation).

For PHANTASMATA, this territory is not one axis among five but the axis that organizes the project's mode of address. All five output formats — video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post — are found-media formats. The $FOUND_FOOTAGE axis — "collapse of narrative authority (found digital, glitched calls, abandoned profiles)" — names the epistemic condition this brief maps historically, technically, and formally. The project's origin document states the principle explicitly: the power of *The Blair Witch Project* "was not the witch, but the collapse of narrative authority: no stable camera, no reliable map, no external confirmation. The terror came from not knowing what kind of reality you were in anymore." This brief historicizes that collapse across four decades of formal evolution.

The epistemic problem is specific: found footage presents itself as a document recovered without mediating authorship. The claim is always false, but the formal apparatus sustains the fiction — degraded frames, shaky pans, the camera pointing at the ground during flight are not failures of cinematography but performances of authenticity. PHANTASMATA's design principle that "audience uncertainty is the design intent" is this problem restated as a production directive.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What are the formal mechanisms by which found footage collapses the boundary between document and fiction, and how have those mechanisms evolved across four decades as audiences have become increasingly literate in the form's conventions?
2. How does the diegetic camera — the camera that exists within the story — reorganize the epistemological contract between film and viewer, and what specific techniques sustain or undermine that contract?
3. What formal innovations distinguish the major national traditions of found-footage horror (American, Japanese, Spanish, European), and what does each tradition contribute to PHANTASMATA's available vocabulary?
4. How does the mockumentary continuum — from comedic parody (*This Is Spinal Tap*) through horror verisimilitude (*Lake Mungo*) to full ontological collapse (*The Blair Witch Project*) — map onto the $FOUND_FOOTAGE axis's parameter space?
5. What is the formal relationship between cinematic found footage (theater-distributed films) and screen-life cinema (films composed entirely of screen interfaces), and does the transition from found tape to found screen represent a categorical break or a continuous evolution?
6. How do the three director dials ($ARGENTO_GEL, $LYNCH_DRIFT, $KON_SPIRAL) interact with the found-footage form, and which dial settings produce outputs native to this domain?
7. What specific formal techniques from found footage's forty-year history are immediately extractable for PHANTASMATA creative production across all five output formats?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. Proto-Found Footage (1980–1998)

#### Cannibal Holocaust: The Snuff-Film Proposition

Ruggero Deodato's *Cannibal Holocaust* (1980) is not the first film to use found footage as a formal strategy — Peter Watkins's *The War Game* (1966) and *Punishment Park* (1971) used documentary-within-fiction structures to devastating political effect earlier. But *Cannibal Holocaust* is the film that established the found-footage form's defining proposition: *what if the film you are watching is a record of real death?* The film's plot frames its central horror footage as documentary reels shot by a crew of American filmmakers who traveled to the Amazon to document indigenous cannibal tribes and were themselves killed. The recovered footage — screened by a television executive deciding whether to broadcast it — constitutes the film's second half, and it presents images of sexual violence, torture, murder, and (controversially, genuinely) animal killing with a verisimilitude so aggressive that Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges and, briefly, investigated for murder.

The legal crisis was not incidental to the film's formal achievement — it was the formal achievement's proof of concept. Italian authorities believed, at least provisionally, that the footage depicted actual killings. Deodato was required to produce his actors alive in court and to demonstrate the special-effects techniques used to simulate the impalement sequence. The courtroom became a screening room where the found-footage form's central proposition — *this might be real* — was tested by the legal apparatus designed to distinguish document from fiction. The legal system's inability to make that distinction immediately, on the basis of the image alone, is the strongest possible validation of the form's epistemic power.

*Cannibal Holocaust*'s formal innovations are specific and foundational. First, the *nested-frame structure*: the "found" footage is embedded within a conventional narrative frame (the television executive's story), creating a two-level reality system where the outer frame is acknowledged fiction and the inner frame performs documentary truth. This nesting allows the film to comment on its own footage — the executive's moral anguish about broadcasting the material mirrors the viewer's moral anguish about watching it, and the film uses this doubling to implicate the viewer in the economics of exploitation. Second, the *degraded image as authenticity marker*: the "found" reels are shot on 16mm with visible grain, unsteady handheld camera, blown-out exposure, and direct-to-camera address by the filmmakers, all of which read as documentary convention. Third, the *genuine atrocity problem*: the film contains real scenes of animal killing (a turtle butchered, a spider monkey decapitated), and the presence of real death within a fiction of real death collapses the epistemic boundary the form depends on. The viewer who knows the animal killings are real can no longer be certain where the reality stops and the fiction begins. This contamination — the insertion of actual cruelty into a simulation of cruelty — is *Cannibal Holocaust*'s most radical and most ethically indefensible formal innovation.

For PHANTASMATA, *Cannibal Holocaust* establishes the genre's maximum ethical boundary. The film demonstrates that the found-footage form's power is proportional to its capacity for deception, and that maximizing that capacity eventually requires harming real beings. PHANTASMATA's mandate is to produce "audience uncertainty" — not actual harm. The project inherits the formal apparatus (nested frame, degraded image, diegetic camera) but must refuse the ethical escalation.

#### Peter Watkins and the Political Fake Documentary

Peter Watkins deserves priority in any genealogy of found footage as epistemic horror, though his work is not horror in the genre sense. *The War Game* (1966) simulated a Soviet nuclear attack on Britain using the formal language of BBC current-affairs documentary — handheld 16mm cameras, direct-to-camera interviews with "survivors," authoritative voiceover narration, on-screen text citing government planning documents. The BBC, which had commissioned the film, refused to broadcast it, calling it "too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting." The refusal is instructive: the BBC recognized that the documentary form's credibility, deployed in the service of fiction, produced an effect that exceeded the institution's tolerance for managed audience distress. A drama about nuclear war would have been acceptable. A document about nuclear war — even a simulated one — was not.

Watkins's *Punishment Park* (1971) extended the technique into a fictional scenario of American political repression, filming a simulated tribunal and desert manhunt with documentary methods so rigorous that some audiences assumed they were watching actual government footage. Watkins's innovation for PHANTASMATA is the *institutional fake* — the simulation of an institutional document (the BBC report, the government tribunal record) whose authority derives not from the individual holding the camera but from the institution the camera implicitly represents. This is a different epistemic proposition from the personal-camera found footage of *Blair Witch* or *Paranormal Activity*. In personal found footage, the authority is "I was there." In institutional found footage, the authority is "the institution has verified this." The second is harder to fake but more powerful when successful.

#### Ghostwatch, Alternative 3, and the Television Breach

The BBC television special *Ghostwatch* (1992) is the found-footage form's most famous television manifestation. Broadcast live on Halloween night, the program presented itself as a real-time investigation of a haunted house in Northolt, London, hosted by actual BBC presenters Michael Parkinson, Sarah Greene, Mike Smith, and Craig Charles. The broadcast followed the conventions of live reality television so faithfully — studio anchor, on-location reporter, phone-in segment, technical difficulties — that a significant portion of the viewing audience believed the haunting was real. The BBC received over 30,000 phone calls during and after the broadcast, many from viewers in genuine distress. The program was linked to the suicide of an 18-year-old man with learning difficulties, and it was never rebroadcast on the BBC.

*Ghostwatch*'s formal innovation is *institutional impersonation*: the program used the BBC's actual credibility infrastructure — real presenters, real studio, real phone-in technology. The audience's belief derived not from shaky camerawork but from the institutional frame: *the BBC does not broadcast fiction as fact; therefore this must be fact*. The deception succeeds precisely to the extent that it parasitizes a real institution's credibility.

*Alternative 3* (1977), broadcast on ITV's *Science Report* series, presented a fictional conspiracy theory about a secret space program as a legitimate documentary. Despite airing on June 20 (three weeks after its scheduled April Fools' Day broadcast date) and carrying end credits that listed the cast, the program generated genuine belief and sustained conspiracy theories for decades. The formal lesson is that the documentary frame's credibility can survive even explicit signals of fictionality — viewers who believed the program simply incorporated the credits and the broadcast date into the conspiracy narrative.

#### The Last Broadcast: The Precedent

Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler's *The Last Broadcast* (1998) preceded *The Blair Witch Project* by a year and used many of the same formal strategies: a documentary crew investigating a local legend (the Jersey Devil) disappears in the Pine Barrens; the recovered footage constitutes the film. The film was shot on consumer-grade digital video, edited on a home computer, and distributed via satellite — technical innovations that, in 1998, were genuinely novel. Its formal contribution to the found-footage lineage is the *meta-documentary structure*: the film presents itself as a documentary about the making of a documentary, creating a reflexive loop in which the act of documenting is itself the narrative's subject. However, *The Last Broadcast* breaks its own formal contract in its final fifteen minutes, abandoning the documentary frame for a conventional third-person narrative reveal that deflates the epistemic tension the rest of the film had built. This structural failure is instructive for PHANTASMATA as a negative example: the found-footage form's power depends on the consistency of its formal commitment, and any lapse into conventional cinema ruptures the epistemic contract that produces the form's distinctive effect.

### B2. The Blair Witch Paradigm (1999)

#### The Marketing Campaign as Formal Innovation

*The Blair Witch Project* (1999), directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, did not invent found footage. It invented found footage as a *total system* — a formal strategy that extended from the film's production through its marketing through its reception through its afterlife, creating a closed loop in which the boundary between the film and the world could not be cleanly drawn. The film's innovations are inseparable from its marketing, and the marketing's innovations are inseparable from the historical moment of its deployment: the summer of 1999, when the internet was mature enough to distribute viral content but young enough that the protocols for distinguishing fact from fiction online had not yet solidified.

The marketing campaign operated on multiple fronts: the website (blairwitch.com) presented the Blair Witch mythology as legitimate local history with fake police reports, fabricated news articles, and missing-person flyers for the protagonists (the actors used their real names). The IMDB listed the actors as "missing, presumed dead." The site launched a year before the film's release and accumulated traffic as standalone internet content.

The result: a significant population of viewers who entered the theater uncertain whether they were watching fiction or documentary. This uncertainty was the marketing's explicit objective, and the film's formal structure sustained it rigorously — no opening credits, no score, no non-diegetic sound, no establishing shots from impossible camera positions, and no resolution. The film ends with Mike standing in a corner facing the wall, the camera dropping to the floor, and cutting to black. No explanation, no climax, no survival.

#### Formal Innovations

The film's formal innovations are precise enough to itemize. First, *dual-camera realism*: the film uses two cameras (a 16mm film camera operated by the character of Heather and a Hi8 video camera operated by the character of Josh), and the visual distinction between the two formats — film's grain versus video's electronic noise, film's richer color versus video's flatter palette — creates a two-register reality system within the diegesis. The film camera represents the documentary project (the film the characters are making); the video camera represents the personal record (what the characters document when they are not "working"). The tension between these two registers — the professional and the personal, the composed and the confessional — is one of the film's primary formal engines.

Second, *improvised dialogue within structured scenarios*: the actors received daily instructions via notes rather than a screenplay, and were genuinely cold, lost, and sleep-deprived throughout the shoot. The resulting speech patterns — halting, repetitive, marked by authentic discomfort — produce a verbal texture that scripted film cannot replicate, reinforcing the epistemic proposition that the footage is real.

Third, *the absent antagonist*: the Blair Witch is never shown. The film is a record of effects without visible cause — stick figures, stone cairns, sounds in the night, a ruined house. This absence makes the footage more credible as a document: a film showing a witch would be identifiable as fiction, but a film showing only ambiguous evidence is formally identical to a documentary about an unexplained phenomenon.

Fourth, *the confessional address*: Heather's close-up monologue — mucus dripping, voice breaking, apologizing to the parents of her companions — collapses the distance between character and actor. Donahue is simultaneously performing and (given the production conditions) genuinely distressed. The close-up eliminates all context, and the direct address makes it impossible for the viewer to determine where performance ends and reality begins.

#### Legacy and Exhaustion

*The Blair Witch Project* grossed approximately $248 million worldwide against a production budget of roughly $60,000, making it one of the most profitable films in cinema history. This commercial success guaranteed that the found-footage form would become an industry — dozens of found-footage horror films followed in the next decade, most of them replicating *Blair Witch*'s formal strategies with diminishing returns. The form's problem is inherent: its power depends on the audience's willingness to entertain the possibility that the footage is real, and each successful found-footage film erodes that willingness by familiarizing the audience with the form's conventions. *Blair Witch* worked in part because audiences had never seen anything quite like it. By the mid-2000s, audiences had seen many things like it, and the form's epistemic proposition had been degraded from "this might be real" to "this is a found-footage movie."

The form's subsequent history is a series of attempts to solve this exhaustion problem — to reinvent the formal apparatus sufficiently to restore the epistemic uncertainty that familiarity had eroded. The most successful solutions involved either changing the camera technology (from film to digital to webcam to screen capture), changing the cultural context (from American woods to Spanish apartments to Korean asylums to Zoom calls), or changing the formal rules (from continuous footage to assembled archive to real-time screen recording).

### B3. The First Wave (2000–2009)

#### [REC] and the Real-Time Trap

Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza's *[REC]* (2007) is the found-footage form's most formally accomplished first-wave entry and arguably its most purely terrifying. A television reporter (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman accompany a fire crew on a call to an apartment building in Barcelona, where they find a woman in a disturbed state who bites a policeman. The building is sealed by health authorities, and the film unfolds in continuous apparent real-time as the trapped occupants discover that a form of demonic infection is spreading through the residents.

*[REC]*'s formal innovations address the found-footage form's two most persistent problems. The first problem — "why are they still filming?" — is solved by making the camerawoman a professional journalist whose professional identity is defined by the act of recording; she continues filming because filming is what she does, and the camera is her tool for making sense of an incomprehensible situation. The second problem — the audience's growing familiarity with found-footage conventions — is solved by *velocity*: the film runs 78 minutes and eliminates all dead time, building from mundane documentary into sustained panic without pause. The viewer has no opportunity to step outside the epistemic frame and evaluate it as a formal strategy, because the film does not provide the temporal space for that evaluation.

The film's climactic night-vision sequence — the reporter crawling through a pitch-black penthouse apartment, visible only through the camera's green-tinted infrared sensor — is the purest expression of the found-footage form's defining proposition: *you can see only what the camera can see, and the camera can barely see anything*. The audience's visual field is reduced to the camera's capability, and when the camera's infrared illumination reveals a figure that should not be there, the audience and the character discover it simultaneously. There is no dramatic irony, no privileged knowledge, no omniscient perspective. The found-footage camera makes the viewer exactly as vulnerable as the character.

*[REC]*'s setting — a Barcelona apartment building, quotidian in every architectural detail — also establishes a formal principle that PHANTASMATA directly inherits: the mundane space as horror container. The film's horror does not take place in a forest, a haunted house, or any space culturally pre-coded as dangerous. It takes place in a residential apartment building — the kind of space the viewer inhabits every day. This spatial ordinariness is the found-footage form's environmental equivalent of the diegetic camera: just as the camera says "this is not a film, this is a document," the setting says "this is not a horror location, this is a building like yours."

#### Paranormal Activity: The Surveillance Camera and the Long Take

Oren Peli's *Paranormal Activity* (2007, released 2009) represents a different solution to the found-footage form's problems — one that replaces *[REC]*'s velocity with *duration*. A couple installs a camera in their bedroom to capture the paranormal activity that has been disturbing their sleep. The film alternates between daytime handheld footage (the couple investigating their situation) and nighttime surveillance footage (the fixed camera recording their bedroom while they sleep). The nighttime sequences — long, static shots of the couple in bed, the timecode scrolling in the corner, the audience scanning the frame for the subtle disturbance they know is coming — are the film's formal core.

Peli's innovation is the *surveillance camera as horror apparatus*: where handheld cameras signify human vulnerability, the fixed camera signifies mechanical observation without consciousness. The surveillance camera does not tremble, does not look away. Its inhuman patience is the dread. The audience watches the fixed frame knowing something will happen, scanning the static image for the subtle disturbance they know is coming. This is found footage deployed through the camera's *excess* rather than its limitation — it sees everything, relentlessly, without prioritizing.

The film's other innovation is the *domestic setting as laboratory*: a tract home in suburban San Diego, architecturally generic, where sufficient depicted banality (arguments about money, discussions about calling a psychic) makes the supernatural incursions register as violations of a real domestic space. The franchise's subsequent diminishing returns ($193 million against a $15,000 budget for the first film, then declining) demonstrate the form's central paradox: success breeds familiarity, and literacy degrades the epistemic proposition.

#### Cloverfield: The Event Film in First Person

Matt Reeves's *Cloverfield* (2008) applied the found-footage form to a genre — the giant-monster movie — that had previously been defined by the spectacle of scale. The formal proposition was provocative: what does a *kaiju* attack look like from the ground, through the lens of a consumer camcorder, from the perspective of someone who has no idea what is happening? The answer, for most of the film, is: confusing. The camera shakes. Dust and debris obscure the frame. The monster is glimpsed in fragments — a tail through a gap between buildings, a leg beyond a rooftop. The film denies the audience the establishing shot, the aerial view, the comprehensive perspective that the monster movie traditionally provides. The viewer's knowledge is bounded by the camera operator's knowledge, which is almost nothing.

*Cloverfield*'s contribution to the found-footage vocabulary is the *restricted-knowledge disaster*: the audience shares the characters' total ignorance about what is attacking the city, transforming the genre from spectacle into epistemological crisis. The form's epistemic restriction becomes a narrative engine — the characters move through the city not toward a goal but toward *information*, trying to see enough to formulate a response.

#### Diary of the Dead and The Poughkeepsie Tapes: The Meta and the Extreme

George Romero's *Diary of the Dead* (2007) applies the found-footage form to the zombie apocalypse with a self-consciousness that borders on essay. A group of film students document the zombie outbreak as it happens, and the film continuously interrogates its own formal premises — characters debate the ethics of filming during a crisis, question whether the camera's presence changes the events it records, and argue about the relationship between documentation and exploitation. Romero's contribution is the *found footage as media critique*: the form is not merely a delivery mechanism for horror but a subject of investigation in its own right.

John Erick Dowdle's *The Poughkeepsie Tapes* (2007) represents the opposite extreme: a mockumentary about a serial killer whose crimes are documented on hundreds of VHS tapes recovered from his home. The film intercuts "documentary" segments (talking-head interviews with FBI agents, forensic experts, and surviving victims) with footage from the killer's tapes, which depict abduction, torture, and murder with a verisimilitude calculated to produce genuine distress. The film was deemed too disturbing for theatrical release and was shelved for years. Its formal contribution is the *archive of cruelty*: the found footage is not a single continuous document but a collection — an organized, cataloged body of recordings that implies system, premeditation, and duration. The killer films not because he is documenting events but because filming is part of his methodology. The camera is not a witness but an instrument of the crime.

### B4. Asian Found Footage: Noroi, Occult, Gonjiam, and the Mediated Uncanny

#### Koji Shiraishi: The Documentary Filmmaker as Horror Protagonist

Japanese found-footage horror developed along a trajectory distinct from its American counterpart, shaped by two cultural specificities: the Japanese documentary tradition's rigorous formalism (inherited from figures like Kazuo Hara and Shinsuke Ogawa) and the Japanese horror tradition's investment in the mediated image as a vector of supernatural contamination (the cursed videotape of *Ringu*, the haunted television of *Poltergeist*). The result is a body of work that treats the camera not merely as a device that records horror but as a device that *attracts* horror — the act of filming, in Japanese found footage, is itself the transgression that summons the supernatural response.

Koji Shiraishi's *Noroi: The Curse* (2005) is the Japanese found-footage tradition's masterwork and one of the finest found-footage films ever made. The film presents itself as the final work of documentary filmmaker Masafumi Kobayashi, who disappeared after completing the film and whose house was destroyed by fire. Kobayashi's documentary investigates a series of seemingly unrelated paranormal phenomena — a woman who hears infant cries from her neighbor's house, a disturbed psychic who appears on a variety show, a group of children performing a ritual in a rural village — and gradually reveals the connections between them, tracing them to an ancient demon called Kagutaba.

*Noroi*'s formal innovations are substantial. First, the *composite-document structure*: the film is not continuous footage from a single camera but an assembled document incorporating multiple media types — Kobayashi's documentary footage, television broadcasts, home video recordings, news reports, and surveillance footage. This multi-source architecture produces a different epistemic effect from the single-camera found-footage model. Where *Blair Witch* produces horror through the limitations of a single perspective (you can see only what Heather's camera sees), *Noroi* produces horror through the convergence of multiple perspectives (each source provides a different fragment, and the horror emerges from the pattern that connects them). This is *archival* horror — the horror of assembling a dossier, of recognizing that individually innocent documents become collectively damning.

Second, *Noroi* deploys *banal media as horror substrate*. Much of the film's footage comes from Japanese television — variety shows, news broadcasts, daytime programs — and the contrast between the cheerful, garish aesthetics of Japanese television and the supernatural dread that contaminates those broadcasts produces a formal uncanniness that American found footage rarely achieves. The demon Kagutaba does not manifest in dark forests or abandoned buildings; it manifests on television, in the bright lights of a variety-show set, in the living rooms of ordinary people being filmed by ordinary cameras. The supernatural enters through the media ecology itself, contaminating the most mundane and most ubiquitous form of visual culture.

Third, *Noroi* solves the "why are they still filming?" problem through *professional obligation*: Kobayashi is a documentary filmmaker, and his documentary is his work. He films because filming is his livelihood and his identity. But Shiraishi adds a complication: as Kobayashi's investigation deepens, his commitment to filming becomes pathological — he continues recording in situations where any rational person would stop, and his insistence on documenting the horror contributes to the horror's escalation. The camera becomes not a tool of investigation but a tool of summoning. This is the found-footage form's most sophisticated treatment of its own formal premise: the camera does not merely record events but participates in them, and the act of documentation is itself a form of ritual.

Shiraishi's *Occult* (2009) extends these principles into even more radical territory. Shiraishi plays himself — a filmmaker investigating a series of seemingly random violent incidents (a mass stabbing at a tourist site, a woman's spontaneous combustion) that are connected by the testimony of a survivor named Eno, who claims to have received a divine mission. The film uses the same multi-source documentary structure as *Noroi* but adds a layer of *autofictional* horror: Shiraishi-the-director is also Shiraishi-the-character, and the film's commitment to its documentary frame is so thorough that the audience cannot determine where Shiraishi's investigation ends and his performance begins. The film builds to a conclusion so extreme — a mass suicide staged as a divine sacrifice, captured on camera in what appears to be real-time — that it forces the viewer to confront the found-footage form's ultimate question: *if this were real, would it look any different?*

#### Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum

Jung Bum-shik's *Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum* (2018) represents the Korean contribution to found-footage horror and updates the form for the livestreaming era. A group of content creators enters the real Gonjiam Psychiatric Hospital — one of South Korea's most famous abandoned buildings — to produce a live horror broadcast. The film's innovation is the *weaponized livestream*: the characters are not merely documenting events for future viewing but broadcasting them in real time to an audience whose engagement (measured in viewer counts and comments) drives the characters' decisions. The content creators push deeper into the hospital not because they are investigating a mystery but because their viewer numbers are climbing.

This is found footage updated for the attention economy. The "why are they still filming?" problem is solved by platform economics: people are watching, and watching generates revenue. The camera is no longer a documentation tool but a *performance* tool, and the performance's audience is visible in real time through the viewer count and comment stream. This maps directly onto PHANTASMATA's video-log and screen-capture formats.

#### Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Pulse (Kairo): The Network as Haunted Space

Kiyoshi Kurosawa's *Pulse* (*Kairo*, 2001) is not strictly found footage, but it is indispensable to any account of found media as epistemic horror because it identifies the formal territory that found footage would eventually have to occupy: the internet as a haunted medium. The film's premise — the dead are entering the world of the living through the internet, manifesting as pixelated figures on webcam feeds and drawing the living into suicidal isolation — treats the network itself as a liminal space, a zone between life and death that digital technology has inadvertently opened.

*Pulse*'s relevance to PHANTASMATA is architectural rather than formal. The film theorizes the condition that makes digital found footage possible: the network as a liminal space through which anything can circulate. Where analog found footage requires the physical recovery of a physical object, digital found footage presupposes a network through which material circulates without physical mediation. *Pulse* identifies this network as inherently uncanny — a space that transforms every screen into a potential portal. PHANTASMATA's screen-capture and mock-post formats operate within this uncanny network space.

### B5. European Found Footage: National Traditions and Formal Variations

#### Trollhunter: The Institutional Document as Comedy-Horror

Andre Ovredal's *Trollhunter* (*Trolljegeren*, 2010) applies the found-footage form to Norwegian folklore with a tonal balance that is unique in the genre: the film is simultaneously a credible found-footage horror film and a deadpan comedy about government bureaucracy. A group of university students investigate a series of mysterious bear killings in western Norway and discover that the government employs a troll hunter — a civil servant named Hans (Otto Jespersen) whose job is to manage Norway's hidden troll population. The film's humor derives from the collision between the mythology of trolls (ancient, monstrous, terrifying) and the reality of Hans's working conditions (bureaucratic paperwork, inadequate equipment, no overtime pay, a supervisor who does not appreciate his work).

*Trollhunter*'s formal contribution is the *institutional found footage as satire*. The film's framing device — the footage was found and released by the Norwegian government, which has redacted certain segments — treats the troll-management program as a government agency subject to the same institutional pressures as any other. This is the SCP Foundation's bureaucratic horror translated into found footage: the comedy and the horror derive from the same source, which is the gap between the mundane institutional frame and the extraordinary content it contains. For PHANTASMATA, *Trollhunter* demonstrates that the found-footage form can accommodate tonal complexity that the genre's association with unrelenting terror tends to obscure.

#### The Borderlands: Sacred Space as Found-Footage Environment

Elliot Goldner's *The Borderlands* (2013; released in the US as *Final Prayer*) follows a team of Vatican investigators — a technician, a researcher, and a skeptical priest — sent to a rural Devon church to evaluate claims of a miracle. The church, dating to the Anglo-Saxon period, displays phenomena that resist the team's rational frameworks, and the investigation escalates from clinical evaluation into genuine terror. The film's climactic sequence — the team descending into a passage beneath the church that constricts around them like a digestive tract — is among the most disturbing images in contemporary horror, producing claustrophobic dread that operates on a purely physical register.

The film's formal innovation is the *institutional-skeptic frame*: the investigators are trained professionals whose cameras (body-mounted GoPros, thermal imaging) are tools of institutional investigation. When the framework fails, the epistemic violation is proportional to the institution's credibility: a Vatican investigator with thermal imaging encountering something his instruments cannot explain produces far greater disturbance than a frightened teenager with a camcorder, because the apparatus meant to explain has instead confirmed the inexplicable.

#### [REC] 2 through [REC] 4: The Franchise Problem

The *[REC]* sequels illustrate the found-footage franchise's characteristic degradation pattern. *[REC] 2* (2009) maintains commitment by adding helmet cameras and multiplying perspectives. *[REC] 3: Genesis* (2012) abandons found footage midway through after a character destroys the camera. *[REC] 4* (2014) abandons the form entirely. This trajectory — rigor, compromise, abandonment — is the franchise lifecycle. The form resists serialization because its power depends on novelty. PHANTASMATA's multi-format, non-serialized structure avoids this: discrete fragments preserve formal freshness across encounters.

### B6. The Mockumentary Bridge: From Parody to Horror

#### Man Bites Dog: The Camera as Accomplice

Remy Belvaux, Andre Bonzel, and Benoit Poelvoorde's *Man Bites Dog* (*C'est arrive pres de chez vous*, 1992) is the found-footage form's most brutal examination of the camera's moral complicity. A documentary crew follows a serial killer named Ben (Poelvoorde) as he goes about his work — murdering victims, disposing of bodies, philosophizing about his craft. The crew begins as ostensibly neutral observers but is gradually drawn into complicity: they help dispose of bodies, participate in a gang rape, and eventually become targets themselves. The film is shot in black-and-white 16mm with the handheld-camera aesthetic of cinema verite, and its horror derives not from the violence itself (which is depicted bluntly rather than graphically) but from the camera's refusal to intervene — and, eventually, from the camera's active participation.

*Man Bites Dog*'s formal contribution is the *ethical collapse of the documentary position*: the camera's presence changes the events it records, documentation is engagement, and sustained observation of violence without intervention is complicity. For PHANTASMATA, this is foundational: every found-footage output necessarily implicates its operator, and the camera's moral position — witness, accomplice, or weapon — is a question every fragment must confront.

#### Behind the Mask: The Slasher as Documentary Subject

Scott Glosserman's *Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon* (2006) is a meta-horror comedy that applies the documentary form to the slasher genre, following a journalist and her crew as they document the preparations of Leslie Vernon, a young man training to become a slasher villain. The film's first two-thirds are shot in documentary style — Leslie gives the crew a tour of his planned killing ground, explains the "rules" of the slasher genre (the virgin survives, the sexually active die, cardio is essential), and demonstrates his training regimen. The film then shifts into conventional horror cinema as Leslie's plan goes into execution and the documentary frame collapses.

The film's mockumentary structure produces horror through *genre self-awareness deployed as narrative content*: Leslie's rational preparation makes his violence more disturbing by demonstrating that slasher actions are products of planning, not madness. For PHANTASMATA, *Behind the Mask* illustrates the mockumentary-horror hybrid's capacity to sustain comedy, horror, and meta-commentary simultaneously without canceling any of them.

#### Lake Mungo: The Found-Footage Film as Grief Study

Joel Anderson's *Lake Mungo* (2008) is the found-footage form's most emotionally sophisticated achievement — a film that uses the mockumentary structure not to generate shock or fear but to investigate grief, loss, and the limits of knowledge about the people we love. The film presents itself as a documentary about the Palmer family's experience after the drowning death of their teenage daughter Alice. As the family discovers secrets about Alice's life — a sexual relationship with a neighbor, a series of photographs she took on a school trip to Lake Mungo that appear to show her own ghost — the documentary structure becomes a mechanism for gradually revealing that the people closest to Alice knew her least.

The film's formal innovation is the *documentary as grief process*. The talking-head interviews, the home video footage, the photographic evidence — all the conventional apparatus of documentary — are deployed not to establish facts but to demonstrate the inadequacy of facts. Each piece of "evidence" the documentary uncovers opens a new layer of mystery rather than resolving the existing one. The photographs that appear to show Alice's ghost are revealed to be hoaxes planted by her brother — but then genuine anomalies are discovered in earlier photographs that no one faked. The documentary structure promises revelation and delivers only deeper uncertainty. This is epistemic horror in its quietest and most devastating register: the horror of not knowing, applied not to a supernatural threat but to a person — a daughter, a sister — who is now permanently unknowable.

*Lake Mungo* is the found-footage film that most closely approaches PHANTASMATA's operative territory. It maps directly to $KON_SPIRAL (mediation collapse, memory unreliability) and $LYNCH_DRIFT (identity blur, mundane anchor dissolution) — the territory where "reality is porous, time folds, desire and fear are indistinguishable."

#### What We Do in the Shadows: The Mockumentary as Genre Preservation

Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's *What We Do in the Shadows* (2014) applies the mockumentary form to vampire mythology, following vampires sharing a flat in Wellington as they navigate mundane cohabitation. The film demonstrates that the mockumentary form can accommodate genuine horror within a comedic framework — sequences of authentic menace work precisely *because* the comedic context has lowered the audience's guard. This tonal versatility is relevant to PHANTASMATA's container model, which does not restrict the found-footage form to a single register.

### B7. Screen Life Cinema: The Found Screen

#### Unfriended: The Desktop as Dramatic Space

Levan Gabriadze's *Unfriended* (2014) represents a categorical break in the found-footage lineage — or, more precisely, its logical terminus. The entire film unfolds on a single laptop screen. The viewer sees what the protagonist (Blaire) sees: her desktop, her Skype call with five friends, her browser tabs, her iMessage conversations, her Spotify playlist. A mysterious seventh participant appears on the Skype call — the account of Laura Barns, a classmate who committed suicide a year earlier after a humiliating video was posted online. One by one, the friends are forced to reveal secrets and are killed when they disconnect or attempt to cheat the ghost's games.

The formal innovation is total: the film eliminates the camera and replaces it with the *screen*. The "found footage" is a screen recording — a capture of the digital interface through which a person conducts their social life. The question shifts from "is this footage real?" to "is this screen real?" — and for any laptop user, the answer is an immediate, visceral yes. The horror operates through interface recognition: the viewer's screen *is* this screen.

*Unfriended*'s most significant achievement is its treatment of *digital multitasking as dramatic action*: Blaire types messages, deletes them, retypes; opens tabs, minimizes windows; begins typing to one friend, hesitates, switches conversations. The cursor hovering over "send," the typing indicator appearing and disappearing — these micro-actions replace close-ups and reaction shots. The interface becomes a stage.

For PHANTASMATA, *Unfriended* is the formal template for the screen-capture output format. The film demonstrates that a screen recording can sustain feature-length dramatic engagement, that digital interfaces are legible dramatic spaces, and that the horror of the digital world operates not through the corruption of images (as in analog found footage) but through the corruption of *interactions* — messages that should not appear, accounts that should not be active, cursors that move without human input.

#### Searching: The Screen as Detective Story

Aneesh Chaganty's *Searching* (2018) applies the screen-life format to a missing-person thriller. A father (John Cho) investigates his daughter's disappearance by navigating her digital life — her social media accounts, her laptop, her browser history, her online friendships. The entire film unfolds through screens: the father's desktop, his daughter's devices, news broadcasts on streaming sites, FaceTime calls. The innovation beyond *Unfriended* is the *screen as investigative space*: the digital interface is not merely the environment in which events unfold but the tool through which they are investigated. The detective's magnifying glass is replaced by the search bar; the suspect's diary is replaced by the browser history; the witness interview is replaced by the social media profile.

*Searching* is a screen-life rendering of *Lake Mungo*'s central horror: the person you live with is a stranger, and the evidence of their strangeness was always available on screens you could have looked at but never did.

#### Host: The Pandemic-Era Found Footage

Rob Savage's *Host* (2020) is the found-footage form's most historically situated achievement — a film whose formal strategies and whose horror are inseparable from the specific conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic's first lockdown. Six friends conduct a seance over Zoom during lockdown, and an entity they inadvertently summon begins manifesting in their individual homes. The film runs 57 minutes (the length of a free Zoom call), unfolds in real time, and was shot remotely by its cast members in their actual homes during actual lockdown.

The production conditions are the formal innovation: real Zoom feeds, real compression artifacts, real homes. Every viewer had spent months on identical calls, and the film's horror operates through the violation of that painfully familiar space. *Host* solves the "why are they still filming?" problem with pandemic elegance: they are on Zoom because lockdown has made the screen the only social space available. The choice is not between filming and not filming but between digital connection and solitary confinement — the found-footage form's most structurally elegant justification for continuous recording, deriving from historical condition rather than character psychology.

#### Deadstream: The Livestream as Found Footage

Joseph and Vanessa Winter's *Deadstream* (2022) completes the found-footage-to-screen-life evolution by making the livestream the film's formal and narrative engine. A disgraced internet personality attempts to rehabilitate his brand by livestreaming an overnight stay in a haunted house. The film displays his broadcast interface — the camera feed, the chat window, the viewer count, the donation alerts — as part of its visual field, and the audience's comments become a narrative element (viewers offer advice, mock the host, and eventually realize that the haunting is real before the host does).

*Deadstream* formalizes the livestream audience as a diegetic presence: the chat window scrolls with real-time reactions, donation alerts interrupt the action, and the viewer count rises and falls with the drama's intensity. This is found footage that has fully absorbed the platform economy — the camera as content-production tool, the horror-audience relationship as consumption rather than observation.

### B8. Found Footage and the Internet: Web-Native Horror

#### Marble Hornets: The YouTube Series as Found-Footage Feature

Troy Wagner and Joseph DeLage's *Marble Hornets* (2009–2014) is the most sustained and most formally accomplished web-native found-footage project. Originally created as a contribution to the Slender Man mythology (discussed in World Research Brief 02), the series spans 92 entries posted to YouTube over five years, plus a parallel channel ("totheark") that posted cryptic response videos. The protagonist, Jay, investigates tapes left by his friend Alex, who was filming a student project called "Marble Hornets" before his behavior became erratic and he disappeared. The tapes reveal the presence of a tall, faceless figure in a suit — the Operator (the series' designation for the Slender Man).

The series' formal innovations are platform-specific. First, *serialized ambiguity*: entries posted individually over months and years, with irregular intervals, produced the horror of *not knowing when the next fragment will arrive* — a temporal dread cinematic found footage cannot produce. Second, *platform-native distribution*: entries appeared in YouTube subscription feeds alongside music videos and vlogs, indistinguishable in format and visual quality from genuine amateur content. The uncanniness was precisely this identity: the horror video that looks exactly like everything else on the platform. Third, *the counter-channel as hostile narrator*: the "totheark" channel posted cryptic, visually distorted response videos from within the fiction, introducing a technique with no cinematic equivalent — *the unreliable second narrator who communicates through the same platform*, creating a textual duel the viewer must decode without external guidance.

For PHANTASMATA, *Marble Hornets* is the most directly relevant precedent. The series demonstrates that the found-footage form can be deployed on a social media platform with full formal rigor, that serialized ambiguity is a viable long-form horror strategy, and that the platform itself (YouTube's upload format, comment system, subscription mechanics) can be incorporated into the formal architecture of the work.

#### YouTube Horror and Creepypasta Distribution

The broader YouTube horror ecosystem — *EverymanHYBRID*, *TribeTwelve*, *The West Records*, and the analog horror movement (Local 58, The Mandela Catalogue, The Backrooms, documented in World Research Brief 02) — represents continued evolution of the web-native found-footage form.

The creepypasta distribution network functions as found footage at the level of text. A story posted to Reddit's NoSleep (where all stories are treated as true) is a textual found document — testimony rather than fiction, circulating without authorial framing, exploiting platform credibility to sustain its truth-claim. This textual dimension is directly relevant to PHANTASMATA's text-fragment and mock-post formats.

### B9. Formal Mechanics: The Found-Footage Grammar

The found-footage form has developed, over four decades, a codified formal grammar. Six foundational techniques constitute its core vocabulary:

**The Diegetic Camera.** The camera exists within the world of the story, generating all subsequent formal constraints: it must have an operator, physical limitations (battery, storage, lens quality), and a position a physical body could occupy. Every limitation is an epistemic asset.

**The "Why Still Filming?" Justification.** Solutions include professional obligation (*[REC]*, *Noroi*), obsessive personality (*Blair Witch*), surveillance infrastructure (*Paranormal Activity*), platform economics (*Gonjiam*, *Deadstream*), and pandemic necessity (*Host*). Each carries different epistemic implications.

**The Degraded Image.** Visual artifacts — grain, static, compression, focus hunting — function as authenticity markers. The specific degradation type encodes the historical moment: VHS tracking for the 1980s-90s, miniDV for the 2000s, Zoom compression for 2020. PHANTASMATA requires degradations native to contemporary digital platforms.

**The Shaky-Cam.** Handheld instability signifies human presence, physical vulnerability, and epistemic limitation. Degree of shake is a calibration tool — mild for casual documentation, violent for panic. The form's history shows refinement from aggressive instability (*Blair Witch*, *Cloverfield*) toward controlled deployment (*[REC]*, *Noroi*).

**Title Cards and Framing Text.** On-screen text establishes the found-footage contract and performs the institutional frame. Typographic style encodes institutional identity: serif for government/academic, sans-serif for corporate media, crude for amateur compilation.

**Direct Address.** A subject speaks into the lens to an implied future audience, collapsing temporal distance between recording and viewing. The effect is confessional, intimate, and deeply uncomfortable — the viewer becomes the intended recipient of a message from a person who may be dead.

## C) Techniques Inventory

**1. Nested Frame Architecture**
The found footage is embedded within a conventional narrative or documentary frame, creating a two-level reality system. The outer frame acknowledges fictionality; the inner frame performs documentary truth. The tension between levels produces epistemic oscillation — the viewer is continuously negotiating which level of reality they are currently occupying. *Cannibal Holocaust*, *The Poughkeepsie Tapes*, *Noroi*. Affinity: video-log (outer frame as editorial intro), text-fragment (framing preamble around recovered text).

**2. Degraded-Image Authentication**
Deliberate introduction of visual artifacts — grain, static, compression, focus hunting — that signify non-professional recording conditions. Functions as a negative-authenticity marker: the image's imperfection is evidence of its documentary origin, because professional productions would correct these defects. *Blair Witch Project*, *Paranormal Activity*, *Marble Hornets*. Affinity: all five output formats (each medium has native degradation signatures).

**3. Real-Time Duration**
The footage unfolds in unbroken apparent real-time, denying the audience the temporal compression that editing provides. Produces the viewer's subjective experience of duration — waiting, boredom, and the sudden irruption of the uncanny. *[REC]*, *Host*, *Paranormal Activity* (nighttime sequences). Affinity: video-log, screen-capture (both formats support uncut duration).

**4. Dual-Camera Parallax**
Two or more cameras record the same events from different perspectives, and the film alternates between their feeds. Produces a split-reality effect: each camera shows a partial truth, and the viewer must assemble a composite picture. *Blair Witch* (16mm and Hi8), *[REC] 2* (helmet cameras), *Gonjiam* (body cameras and fixed cameras). Affinity: video-log (multiple operators), screen-capture (split-screen interfaces).

**5. Surveillance Stasis**
A fixed camera records a space over extended duration, and the viewer scans the static frame for anomalies. Produces the horror of attention — the viewer becomes hyper-vigilant, investing ordinary details with potential significance. *Paranormal Activity*, *Paranormal Activity 3* (oscillating fan-camera), *Creep* (laptop webcam). Affinity: screen-capture (desktop idle states), video-log (fixed security footage).

**6. Confessional Direct Address**
A subject speaks directly to the camera, addressing an implied future viewer. Produces temporal collapse — the viewer becomes the intended audience of a message from a potentially dead person — and emotional intimacy that third-person narration cannot achieve. *Blair Witch* (Heather's apology), *Lake Mungo* (family interviews), *Deadstream* (livestream monologue). Affinity: video-log (personal testimony), audio-log (voice memo confession).

**7. Platform Impersonation**
The film adopts the visual language and interface conventions of a real media platform (YouTube, Skype, Zoom, a social media feed), exploiting the platform's familiarity to produce uncanny recognition. *Unfriended* (Skype/macOS desktop), *Searching* (Google/FaceTime), *Host* (Zoom). Affinity: screen-capture (entire format is platform impersonation), mock-post (social media interface replication).

**8. Title-Card Institutional Framing**
On-screen text establishes the footage's provenance and context before the first image appears, performing the authority of a reviewing institution. The title card creates the epistemic contract: the viewer agrees to treat the footage as a recovered document. *Cannibal Holocaust*, *Blair Witch*, *[REC]*, *Cloverfield*. Affinity: video-log (law-enforcement or journalistic headers), text-fragment (editorial preface).

**9. Audio-Priority Horror**
The camera's visual field is restricted or eliminated (darkness, obstruction, camera facing the ground), and the audience relies on audio to determine what is happening. Produces the horror of auditory imagination — the viewer constructs the unseen threat from sound, and the imagined threat is always worse than the visible one. *Blair Witch* (tent scene), *[REC]* (night-vision climax), *Paranormal Activity* (nighttime sounds). Affinity: audio-log (entire format is audio-priority), video-log (camera-down or camera-obscured segments).

**10. Found-Archive Assembly**
The film is assembled from multiple media types — video footage, photographs, television broadcasts, home movies, audio recordings — creating a composite document whose authority derives from the convergence of independent sources. *Noroi*, *Lake Mungo*, *Searching*, *The Poughkeepsie Tapes*. Affinity: all five formats (PHANTASMATA's multi-format strategy IS a found-archive assembly).

**11. Camera-as-Weapon**
The camera or its light source is used as an instrument within the narrative — the flash blinds an attacker, the night-vision reveals an invisible threat, the camera is swung as a blunt weapon. Collapses the distinction between the recording instrument and the survival tool, making the act of filming a form of combat. *[REC]* (camera flash in dark), *Cloverfield* (night-vision in tunnel), *Chronicle* (telekinetic camera). Affinity: video-log (camera-as-flashlight sequences), screen-capture (screen light as the only illumination).

**12. Temporal Disjunction via Timecode**
Visible timecodes, datestamps, or file metadata create a parallel temporal narrative that may contradict the events shown. A jump in timecode implies missing footage; a corrupted datestamp implies tampering; continuous timecode implies real-time fidelity. *Paranormal Activity* (timecode as tension clock), *The Poughkeepsie Tapes* (tape labels as chronology), *Marble Hornets* (entry numbering as incomplete chronology). Affinity: video-log (embedded file metadata), screen-capture (system clock discrepancies).

**13. The Unreliable Operator**
The camera operator's choices — what they point the camera at, what they refuse to film, when they turn the camera off — reveal character, deception, or psychological collapse. The camera's selectivity is legible as testimony about the operator's mental state. *Creep* (Josef's performative charisma), *The Visit* (children editing their own footage), *Man Bites Dog* (crew's escalating complicity). Affinity: video-log (operator's choices visible in real time), audio-log (recording decisions as editorial acts).

**14. Night-Vision Reveal**
A shift to infrared or night-vision mode transforms the visual field into a green-tinted, flattened, otherworldly space where depth is ambiguous and movement is difficult to track. The night-vision mode reveals what ordinary vision cannot see, making the camera's technological capability a source of both knowledge and dread. *[REC]* (penthouse climax), *Paranormal Activity 4* (Xbox Kinect dots), *Grave Encounters* (abandoned-asylum exploration). Affinity: video-log (camera night-mode activation), screen-capture (screen in dark room as sole light source).

**15. The Interrupted Recording**
The footage cuts abruptly — battery death, physical impact, deliberate termination — and the cut itself becomes an event. What happens after the cut is unknown, and the viewer's imagination fills the gap. *Blair Witch* (final cut to black), *Cloverfield* (bridge attack cut), *Host* (disconnections). Affinity: all five formats (every digital format can be "interrupted" by technical failure or deliberate termination).

**16. The Reluctant Subject**
A person being filmed resists, objects to, or attempts to evade the camera. Their resistance to documentation is itself legible as evidence — of shame, guilt, fear, or awareness of something the camera should not see. *Catfish* (the internet-persona reveal), *The Blair Witch Project* (Mike's resistance to filming), *Creep* (moments where Josef drops his mask). Affinity: video-log (subjects covering the lens), screen-capture (someone closing a window or blocking the camera).

**17. Diegetic Sound Design**
All sound is produced by sources present in the filmed space — no score, no non-diegetic sound effects, no foley. The audio field is limited to what the camera's microphone can capture, including wind noise, handling noise, and audio overload. *Blair Witch* (wind and breathing), *[REC]* (screaming and impacts), *Paranormal Activity* (silence punctuated by thuds). Affinity: audio-log (the entire format is diegetic sound), video-log (microphone limitations as formal constraint).

**18. The False Resolution**
An apparent explanation is provided for the footage's anomalies — a prank, a misunderstanding, a technical malfunction — and then undermined by subsequent evidence. Produces an epistemic whiplash: the viewer's relief at the rational explanation is retroactively contaminated by the evidence that the explanation was wrong. *Lake Mungo* (the brother's hoax, followed by genuine anomalies), *Paranormal Activity* (the "it's just the house settling" dismissals), *Noroi* (rational explanations overwhelmed by accumulating evidence). Affinity: text-fragment (debunking post followed by contradicting evidence), mock-post (comment thread oscillating between skepticism and belief).

**19. The Embedded Viewer**
The footage includes an audience — a chat window, a viewer count, comments, or an in-fiction screening where characters watch recovered footage. The embedded viewer mirrors the actual viewer's position, creating a recursive loop of observation. *Deadstream* (chat window), *Gonjiam* (viewer count), *Cannibal Holocaust* (television executives screening the footage), *Sinister* (Ethan Hawke watching the 8mm films). Affinity: screen-capture (chat and comment overlays), mock-post (reply threads and reactions).

**20. Medium Contamination**
The boundary between the found footage and the "real" medium of its presentation is breached — a glitch from the found footage appears to affect the broadcast, the film's credits are disrupted by the footage's content, or the footage appears to "leak" into the surrounding media environment. *Ghostwatch* (the studio broadcast contaminated by the haunting), *Unfriended* (the desktop interface behaving anomalously), *The Ring* (the cursed tape's images appearing in other contexts). Affinity: screen-capture (interface glitches that appear to originate from the content), mock-post (posts or comments that appear in contexts where they should not exist).

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### Dial Recipes for Found-Footage Production

The found-footage form interacts distinctively with each of the three director dials, and the interaction defines the tonal territory of the resulting output.

**$ARGENTO_GEL in found footage** produces productive paradox: chromatic extravagance conflicts with the degraded-image aesthetic. A video-log deploying bold colored lighting through a phone camera's limited dynamic range creates an image simultaneously "real" (camera quality) and "unreal" (color) — a perceptual disturbance that does not break the documentary contract because phone cameras in nightclubs capture exactly these oversaturated images. Recommended range: $ARGENTO_GEL 20-50 (color as subtle contamination, not operatic spectacle). Above 50, the form reads as stylized rather than documentary.

**$LYNCH_DRIFT in found footage** enters the form's most powerful PHANTASMATA configuration. A video-log where the operator's voice changes subtly over successive entries, where familiar spaces acquire imperceptible wrongness, where the camera captures details the operator does not notice — this is where $LYNCH_DRIFT and found footage amplify each other. *Lake Mungo* operates here: documentary conventions create a normality baseline that Lynchian disturbances violate with maximum effect. Recommended range: $LYNCH_DRIFT 40-80. Below 40, the register is too subtle for found-footage roughness to transmit. Above 80, the reality anchor dissolves past the found-footage contract's tolerance.

**$KON_SPIRAL in found footage** makes the form a hall of mirrors. The boundary between real and mediated is already found footage's subject; when $KON_SPIRAL is elevated, the footage interrogates its own premise — the operator questions whether footage is being manipulated, the recording shows events the operator does not remember filming. This is PHANTASMATA's most native configuration. Recommended range: $KON_SPIRAL 30-70. Above 70, recursive self-interrogation risks becoming cerebral rather than affectively disturbing.

### Format Inheritance Map

Each of PHANTASMATA's five output formats inherits specific formal resources from the found-footage tradition.

The **video-log** inherits the full found-footage grammar and can deploy any of the twenty techniques inventoried above. Primary risk: cliche. The **screen-capture** inherits screen-life cinema's innovations (platform impersonation, interface-as-dramatic-space, embedded viewer); its advantage is relative unfamiliarity. The **audio-log** inherits audio-priority horror — the most formally constrained format, where every sound must be legible as both environmental document and narrative event. The **text-fragment** inherits the creepypasta tradition's platform-native presentation and formatting-as-authority (see World Research Brief 02). The **mock-post** inherits medium contamination — a horror fragment appearing within social media conventions, exploiting platform familiarity for uncanny recognition.

### Practical Guidance for PHANTASMATA Production

Three operational principles emerge from this brief's forty-year survey.

First, *epistemic calibration over spectacle*. Every formal decision either increases or decreases the audience's uncertainty about the footage's ontological status. The calibration point is the zone where footage is *almost* credible as a real document but contains elements that resist rational explanation without being identifiable as manufactured horror effects. Too many horror conventions (jump scares, dramatic lighting) signal fictionality; too few horror elements produce indistinguishable amateur video. PHANTASMATA works should operate in the narrow zone between.

Second, *platform specificity over format generality*. The form's power is proportional to how precisely it mimics the medium it impersonates. *Blair Witch* mimics 16mm/Hi8 with professional precision; *Unfriended* mimics macOS with daily-user precision; *Host* mimics Zoom with lockdown-veteran precision. Vague "found footage" that gestures at documentary convention without committing to a specific medium is always less effective. PHANTASMATA outputs must be made *for* specific platforms with recognition-producing precision.

Third, *formal commitment without formal rigidity*. The tradition's best works commit fully to their formal premise while finding creative solutions to the constraints it imposes: *[REC]* finds visual variety through setting architecture; *Noroi* achieves emotional range through media-source diversity; *Lake Mungo* achieves horror through accumulated photographic evidence. PHANTASMATA's lo-fi, diegetic, found-digital constraint should generate invention, not limitation.
