## A) Topic Definition and Scope

This brief investigates the formal grammars of Asian horror cinema — the distinct regional vocabularies of dread, supernatural logic, and social critique that emerged across the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The scope consolidates two research paths frequently treated as a single undifferentiated mass by Western criticism but recognized by PHANTASMATA as a constellation of distinct traditions: *J-horror* (the Japanese horror wave of 1998-2005 and its antecedents and descendants) and *pan-Asian horror* (the Korean, Thai, Indonesian, Filipino, and Hong Kong traditions that developed in parallel, in dialogue with, and in creative tension against the J-horror model). These traditions share a common formal ancestor (the ghost story rooted in animist and folk-religious worldviews), a common industrial context (national film industries negotiating between domestic and international genre markets), and a common formal innovation (the production of horror through atmosphere and contamination of the mundane, rather than through explicit violence).

For PHANTASMATA, this domain operates at the intersection of multiple project axes. J-horror's central achievement — the cursed media object, the ghost transmitted through technology — maps directly onto the $FOUND_FOOTAGE axis and onto the $KON_SPIRAL dial. Ringu crystallized an equation PHANTASMATA inherits: the medium of transmission is the medium of haunting. Korean horror's formal signature — family as sanctuary-and-prison, social hierarchy as horror architecture, revenge as structure — maps onto the $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS axis and the $LYNCH_DRIFT dial's territory of mundane anchor dissolution. Southeast Asian traditions provide supernatural grammars rooted in animist worldviews that treat the boundary between living and dead, material and spiritual, as fundamentally more porous than Western rationalism permits.

The epistemological distinction organizing this brief: Asian horror traditions produce horror from a different relationship to the question of the real. Western horror operates within a rationalist framework — the supernatural frightens because it violates the rational order. J-horror and its pan-Asian cognates operate from a different premise: the supernatural is not a violation of the natural order but a dimension of it. Ghosts exist. Curses are real mechanisms with real transmission vectors. The horror is not that the supernatural exists but that you have come into contact with it and the contact cannot be reversed. Where Western horror asks "is it real?", J-horror asks "does the distinction matter?" — and the answer is no. The curse will kill you whether or not you believe in it. This epistemological shift — from horror-as-violation-of-rationalism to horror-as-contact-with-the-always-present — makes Asian horror formally essential to a project whose core principle is "horror as epistemology, not genre decoration."

PHANTASMATA's container mandate — "works where reality is porous, time folds, desire and fear are indistinguishable" — describes the operating condition of Asian horror cinema with precision. In Ringu, reality is porous (the dead woman climbs out of the television). In Ju-On, time folds (the curse contaminates past, present, and future simultaneously). In A Tale of Two Sisters, desire and fear are indistinguishable. In Pulse, the internet is the membrane through which the dead seep into the living world. These are not metaphors for porosity; they are literal demonstrations of it.

**Research questions guiding this brief:**

1. What formal mechanisms produce J-horror's atmospheric dread, and how do they derive from the yūrei tradition's specific visual grammar?
2. How does J-horror's cursed-media-object innovation relate to Japanese cultural attitudes toward technology and the sacred, and what does this mean for PHANTASMATA's deployment of similar techniques?
3. What formal resources does Korean horror provide that J-horror does not — specifically regarding family, class, revenge, and social hierarchy as structural engines?
4. How do Southeast Asian horror traditions draw on animist worldviews to produce supernatural grammars unavailable in Western or Japanese frameworks?
5. What was lost in the Hollywood remake pipeline, and what does translation failure reveal about horror mechanisms' cultural specificity versus formal portability?
6. How do the three director dials map onto the formal vocabularies documented here?
7. Which techniques are immediately extractable for PHANTASMATA production across all five output formats?

## B) Reality vs. Artifice Decomposition

### B1. J-Horror Wave (1998–2005): The Technological Ghost

#### Ringu: The Cursed Tape and the Contagion of Watching

Hideo Nakata's Ringu (1998) solved a problem horror cinema had circled for decades: how to make spectatorship itself the mechanism of horror. The premise — watch a cursed videotape, receive a phone call, die in seven days unless you copy the tape and show it to someone else — makes the supernatural threat and the act of media consumption identical. You are not frightened by the tape's content (surreal but not conventionally terrifying). You are frightened because the act of watching has made lethal contact with you.

The formal innovation: watching = infection. Every viewer of Ringu occupies the same structural position as the film's characters — they too watch the cursed video (the film contains the tape's content within its runtime). The film's refusal to rationalize the curse's mechanism means the viewer cannot fully discharge anxiety through analysis. You know it is fiction. But the film has made you perform the act the fiction says will kill you.

Sadako Yamamura — the dead girl who climbs from the well and emerges from the television screen — is the yūrei rendered in definitive form. Long black hair, white garment, disjointed movement, one visible eye. But her deployment through the television is Nakata's contribution. She haunts not a house or a person but a medium. The screen is not a window onto the horror; the screen is the horror's portal into your living room.

The tape's content — the surreal images Sadako's psychic power imprinted onto videotape — functions as dream-footage within a narratively coherent frame. Unlike surrealist dream sequences (marked by sleep, announced by visual cues), the cursed tape is marked as media object. You encounter it not as a dream but as a recording. Dream-logic with the evidentiary weight of documentary.

Nakata's style is defined by withholding. Static camera, desaturated palette, minimal score, almost no jump scares. Horror accumulates through atmosphere: the creeping sense of wrongness in environments that appear normal. A television turns on — not with dramatic crash but with the quiet click of ordinary power-on. The mundane is revealed as the supernatural's habitat. This is $LYNCH_DRIFT operating through J-horror vocabulary: mundane anchor dissolution achieved through slow revelation that the ordinary world was never safe.

For PHANTASMATA: a found-digital work consumed on a phone screen does not merely depict horror through the phone — it performs the phone as potential vector. The phone is already in your hand. The contact has already been made. Ringu's formal logic extends further: the curse is perpetuated through copying and sharing. The solution to the curse is not to destroy the tape but to distribute it — to make someone else watch. This makes the audience's natural impulse after a powerful horror experience (tell someone, share the link, recommend the film) into a structurally identical act to the curse's propagation mechanism. The viral distribution of PHANTASMATA outputs — the share, the repost, the "you have to see this" — is the curse's formal descendant. The medium that distributes the horror is the medium through which the horror operates, and the audience that distributes it becomes the horror's agent.

The seven-day deadline introduces a temporal structure that is both narratively effective and formally significant: the curse operates on a timer. This is the horror of the countdown — you know the death is coming, you know exactly when, and the knowledge does not help. For found-digital PHANTASMATA outputs, the equivalent is the timed element: the notification that a file will expire, the story that will auto-delete, the countdown embedded in the metadata. Temporal pressure is Ringu's structural gift to digital horror.

#### Ju-On: Space as Curse Container

Takashi Shimizu's Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) displaced J-horror's mechanism from media object to space. In Ringu, the curse has a vector and deadline. In Ju-On, the curse inhabits a house. You enter. You are cursed. You leave. The curse follows. You die. The house is saturated by onnen — the grudge of Kayako Saeki, whose rage at death imprinted itself on the physical space and became self-perpetuating.

The formal innovation is the non-linear structure. Scenes are organized by proximity to the cursed house, not chronologically. Characters who die in one vignette appear alive in later ones set earlier in time. The viewer reconstructing the timeline discovers the curse's effects preceded its causes. The non-chronological structure is formal necessity — the curse does not respect linear time, so the narrative cannot either.

Shimizu's visual grammar: Kayako's disarticulated stair-descent, the death-rattle croak, Toshio's pale blue skin, black hair emerging in wrong places — under blankets, filling drains, spreading across ceilings. The hair is real hair, arranged to produce the impression of organic autonomy. Material-as-horror connects to Svankmajer's tactile surrealism: physical substance behaving in ways physical substances should not.

For PHANTASMATA: Ju-On's spatial-curse model maps onto location-based formats. A text-fragment structured as a property listing gradually revealing wrongness. A video-log series where a visited location's contamination follows the subject home. Multi-format outputs with inconsistent dates, forcing audience timeline reconstruction.

#### Dark Water: Domestic Mundanity as Horror Infrastructure

Nakata's Dark Water (2002) scales J-horror to the domestic. Yoshimi, mid-custody-battle, moves into a run-down apartment. Water stains spread. A red child's bag reappears. The upstairs drips endlessly. The formal achievement: rendering mundane domestic misery — leaking ceiling, bad apartment, exhaustion of single motherhood — as simultaneously naturalistic and supernatural infrastructure. The water damage is both plumbing problem and spiritual intrusion. Dual causality maintained throughout until the supernatural overwhelms in the final act.

The film's climax — Yoshimi sacrificing herself to protect her daughter, becoming a ghost trapped with the dead child she has adopted in death — transforms the maternal horror into maternal horror of a different kind: the mother who cannot stop mothering, even in death. The final image of Yoshimi's ghost, standing in the flooded elevator with the ghost-child she has absorbed into her afterlife, inverts the J-horror onryō — this ghost is not vengeful but loving, and the love is the horror. She will mother this dead child forever. She has chosen the dead over the living. Her actual daughter will grow up motherless because Yoshimi could not refuse the claim of the ghost-child's need.

For PHANTASMATA: the template for domestic found-digital horror. A video-log documenting apartment problems that maintains dual causality — is this a bad apartment or a supernatural event? The format's documentary premise strengthens dual causality because the audience's default assumption for found footage is naturalistic. The water stain that spreads between uploads. The bag that reappears after being discarded. The child who talks to someone not visible. These are PHANTASMATA-native elements drawing power from the format's presumptive realism. Dark Water also provides the emotional template for horror rooted in care — the horror of loving too much, of being unable to refuse someone's need even when the someone is dead.

#### Pulse (Kairo): The Internet as Afterlife

Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Pulse (2001) is the J-horror film most relevant to PHANTASMATA's digital-horror mandate. Its thesis: the internet is the afterlife and loneliness is the mechanism of haunting. People throughout Tokyo begin vanishing — not dying but fading, dissolving into dark stains on walls — as the boundary between living and dead erodes through digital connectivity.

Kurosawa's formal strategy is radical slowness. Scenes extend beyond comfort — a figure in a dark room, static camera, no cut, no movement, sixty to a hundred and twenty seconds. The viewer's attention drifts and snaps back, replicating the browsing-state of digital consumption — present and absent, watching but not fully watching. The ghosts manifest during the attention gap: not jump scares but quiet appearances that may or may not have been noticed. They do not attack. They approach slowly, pathetically needy. They are lonely. The internet is the afterlife because it is a space of infinite connection and infinite loneliness.

The film's most celebrated sequence: a ghost approaching with overcranked footage (filmed faster, played normal speed), producing movement that is human but temporally wrong. The ghost simply approaches. The approach is the horror. The loneliness of the dead seeking the living, unable to make contact that satisfies, is rendered as a physical approach that can never arrive at its object.

Pulse predicted, in 2001, the specific texture of digital-age loneliness that would become the defining emotional condition of the social media era. The film's thesis — increasing connectivity produces increasing isolation, the internet's promise of universal communication is a ghost's promise — was prophetic in ways that have only intensified in the quarter-century since its release. The image of people dissolving into dark stains on walls — leaving behind only a shadow, a mark, a trace of their former presence — is an uncanny anticipation of the digital profile that persists after its owner has disappeared: the account that stops posting, the last-seen timestamp that never updates, the profile picture of someone who no longer exists.

For PHANTASMATA: radical slowness as temporal register, the screen as membrane between worlds. A video-log recording a webcam feed of an empty room for uncomfortable duration, during which something may or may not change. A mock-post from an account whose activity patterns suggest something has gone wrong — not dramatic disappearance but gradual dissolution, posts becoming less frequent, less coherent, less recognizably human, until the account falls silent and the silence itself becomes the horror. Pulse gives PHANTASMATA its emotional register for digital horror: not terror but sadness, not the scream but the whimper, not the monster's attack but the lonely ghost's approach that will never arrive.

#### Audition: The Genre Trap

Takashi Miike's Audition (1999) deploys genre as trap. A widowed producer holds fake auditions to meet romantic partners, becomes fascinated by the quiet, beautiful Asami. The first hour is patient romantic drama — the audience adjusts, relaxes. Then: the camera pans across Asami's apartment, revealing a large burlap sack on the floor. The sack moves. This single image retroactively transforms everything and forward-contaminates everything to come. The romantic drama was the horror film's first act. The audience's trust in genre conventions was the mechanism by which horror approached undetected.

The film's final act — Asami's methodical torture of Aoyama using acupuncture needles inserted into his body one by one, culminating in the piano-wire scene — is shocking in its extremity, but the shock is not the point. The point is the structural betrayal: the audience was told, by every formal convention the first hour deployed, that this was a romantic drama about a lonely man finding connection. The audience's investment in that romance — their desire for the character to find love, their projection of their own romantic hopes onto the narrative — is what makes the horror devastating. You were not just watching a horror film; you were hoping for a love story, and the film used your hope as the mechanism of its attack.

For PHANTASMATA: the genre bait-and-switch. A mock-post that begins as genuine dating profile and accumulates sinister details. A video-log that begins as apartment tour and, without conventional horror signaling, becomes documentation of something wrong. A text-fragment that reads as personal essay or journal entry, deploying the conventions of confessional writing, and gradually reveals content that transforms the confessional mode into something uncanny. The principle is that the audience's genre expectations are not merely context for the horror — they are the mechanism the horror exploits. The deeper the audience's investment in the initial genre, the more devastating the transformation.

#### Additional J-Horror Landmarks

One Missed Call (Miike, 2003): the curse transmitted through mobile phone — a voicemail from the future containing the sound of your own death. The phone-as-vector: the most intimate device becomes the mechanism by which death announces itself. Marebito (Shimizu, 2004): a cameraman obsessed with capturing fear descends into tunnels beneath Tokyo, finds a woman who drinks blood. The diegetic/extradiegetic camera collapse maps onto PHANTASMATA's found-footage framework. Noroi: The Curse (Shiraishi, 2005): found-footage horror assembled from interviews, archival footage, television clips, and amateur video — the J-horror film most aligned with PHANTASMATA's multi-format strategy, demonstrating horror assembled from fragmentary multi-format evidence.

### B2. J-Horror's Cultural Roots

#### Onryō: The Wronged Woman Returns

The J-horror visual grammar — female ghost, long black hair, white garment, pale skin, disarticulated movement — codifies the yūrei (幽霊) tradition extending back centuries in Japanese art and literature. The yūrei is the spirit of the dead unable to pass to the afterlife due to unresolved attachments — typically grudge, grief, or desire. The onryō (怨霊) is the specific subcategory driven by vengeance: overwhelmingly a woman wronged in life who returns to inflict suffering on those who wronged her, or on anyone who enters her sphere of influence.

Yotsuya Kaidan (1825), a kabuki play by Tsuruya Nanboku IV, established the template: Oiwa, disfigured and murdered by her husband, returns as onryō to torment and destroy him. The visual conventions — disheveled hair, white burial kimono, disfigured face, ability to appear in mirrors and lanterns — became the template for two centuries of Japanese ghost representation. Bancho Sarayashiki provides the well-image: the servant Okiku murdered and thrown into a well, whose ghost emerges nightly to count plates. Sadako climbing from the well in Ringu is Okiku's direct visual descendant.

Maruyama Okyo's painting "The Ghost of Oyuki" (c. 1750) established the convention that persists through J-horror: the ghost floating without visible feet (suggesting detachment from the earthly plane), hair unbound and falling over the face, white garment, a posture combining approach and retreat — the ghost comes toward you with reluctance, compulsion rather than aggression. This is crucial: the J-horror ghost is not a predator. She is a victim whose victimhood has become a force that cannot be contained. She does not choose to haunt; she is compelled. The horror is not her agency but her inability to stop.

The kaidan tradition — Lafcadio Hearn's Kwaidan (1904), Masaki Kobayashi's Kwaidan film (1964) — established the literary and cinematic precedent for atmospheric ghost stories that prioritize mood, ambiguity, and the porousness of the boundary between living and dead over narrative resolution or spectacular horror. Kobayashi's film, with its painterly compositions and deliberately artificial sets, demonstrated that Japanese ghost stories could function as art cinema — a precedent that enabled J-horror's simultaneous address to genre audiences and festival audiences.

The distinction from Western ghosts is epistemologically consequential. The Western ghost is a mystery to be solved — the haunting ceases when truth is revealed. The yūrei is not a mystery but a condition. Revealing truth does not stop the haunting. In Ringu, the characters discover Sadako's history, find her body, give proper burial — and the curse continues. Knowledge does not save you. The Western formula (investigate, discover, resolve) is explicitly rejected. J-horror's formula: investigate, discover, fail to resolve.

This epistemological structure is PHANTASMATA's formal engine for J-horror engagement. Found-digital outputs present fragments inviting investigation but refuse resolution. The audience investigates. Information accumulates. The horror continues because it was never a problem to be solved — it was a condition to be endured.

#### Technological Animism

J-horror's technology-as-supernatural derives from Shinto's animist dimension: spirits (kami) inhabit crafted objects, especially those saturated by human use. The concept of tsukumogami — objects acquiring spirits at their hundredth year — establishes cultural precedent for the idea that manufactured things can be spiritually active. The cursed television is not categorical impossibility but logical extension: in a culture where an old umbrella can become a spirit, a television that transmits ghosts is coherent.

For PHANTASMATA: the phone, the laptop, the screen are objects saturated with emotional residue. In animist logic, they are not neutral. They have absorbed what has passed through them. A PHANTASMATA output consumed on a phone inherits the phone's accumulated charge — the found-digital format, presenting itself as native product of the device, claims to be evidence of that charge's supernatural expression.

This animist framework also explains why J-horror's technological ghosts feel formally different from the Western "technology-gone-wrong" narrative (HAL 9000, Terminator, Black Mirror). The Western technology-horror tradition treats technology as a tool that exceeds its intended function or turns against its creator — the Frankenstein structure. The Japanese technology-horror tradition treats technology as a vessel that has been spiritually inhabited — the tsukumogami structure. The difference is not aesthetic but ontological: in the Western version, the horror is that technology has become autonomous (gained something it should not have). In the Japanese version, the horror is that technology has become inhabited (received something that was always possible). PHANTASMATA's found-digital horror should lean toward the inhabitation model rather than the autonomy model: the device is not malfunctioning, it is occupied.

#### Manga Horror: Ito, Umezu, Hino

Junji Ito's Uzumaki (1998-1999) — the manga of spirals — establishes the obsessive form: reality conforms to a geometric pattern that propagates through visual attention. You see the spiral, you become the spiral. This maps onto $KON_SPIRAL's "obsession recursion." Ito's Tomie (1987-2000) predates Ringu in establishing the beautiful dead woman who returns: murdered, regenerated, driving obsession and violence in endless cycle. Each Tomie is identical but distinct — the horror of the copy, the reproduction.

Kazuo Umezu's The Drifting Classroom (1972-1974) — an elementary school catapulted to a barren wasteland where children must survive without adult infrastructure — establishes the social-horror template feeding Korean horror's treatment of institutional collapse. Hideshi Hino renders the body as landscape of horror: bodies that leak, burst, decompose, that are containers whose containment is always failing. This body-as-failing-container principle connects to PHANTASMATA's $GRINDHOUSE axis.

### B3. Korean Horror: Family, Class, and the Architecture of Revenge

#### A Tale of Two Sisters: The Haunted House as Family Diagram

Kim Jee-woon's A Tale of Two Sisters (2003): two sisters return from a psychiatric institution to their family home, terrorized by a cruel stepmother and supernatural events. The film's achievement is structural unreliability — the revelation that the narrative is product of a dissociative state. One sister is dead. The stepmother's cruelty is partially projection. The viewer's post-revelation reconstruction produces not clarity but deeper uncertainty.

The haunted-house structure functions as diagram of family trauma. The house's spaces — bedroom, stepmother's territory, father's study, closet, the space beneath the sink — are psychic zones, each corresponding to a relationship, a trauma, a suppressed memory. The ghost under the sink, the thing in the wardrobe, the blood on the floor — each maps to a specific unprocessed family wound. Supernatural events are both "real" within the fiction and symbolic of psychological architecture. The film maintains this dual register without resolving it, and the refusal to choose between literal and psychological is the horror's formal engine.

Kim Jee-woon's visual grammar reinforces the psychic-diagram structure: the widescreen frame isolates characters within spaces that should feel intimate but instead feel observed. The camera frequently positions itself at the end of a hallway or corner of a room, watching from a distance that implies a presence the characters do not acknowledge. This architectural voyeurism — the house watching its inhabitants — maps directly onto found-footage principles: the camera occupies a position no character has placed it, implying an observer outside the story's acknowledged population.

Acknowledged by Ari Aster as direct influence on Hereditary: both films use family home as psychic diagram, deploy supernatural horror as simultaneously literal and psychological, center on maternal grief as destructive force, and refuse the rational resolution Western audiences expect. The A Tale of Two Sisters-to-Hereditary lineage is the clearest demonstration of Korean horror's structural influence on contemporary Western horror — not a stylistic borrowing but a fundamental reconception of what haunted-house horror can achieve when the house is understood as the family's psychic architecture made physical.

The Korean concept of jeong (정) — the complex emotional bond combining love, attachment, obligation, and habitual affection — provides the emotional substrate. The horror is not that the family is dysfunctional but that the family is bound by jeong so powerful that even death cannot sever it. The ghost is terrifying because it wants to return to the family, and the family's jeong enables the return.

#### The Vengeance Trilogy: Revenge as Architecture

Park Chan-wook's trilogy — Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002), Oldboy (2003), Lady Vengeance (2005) — investigates revenge as structural principle: revenge generates a self-perpetuating system in which perpetrator/victim distinctions collapse, and the act of revenge transforms the avenger into what they sought to destroy.

Oldboy is most formally radical. Oh Dae-su, imprisoned fifteen years without explanation, is released and given five days to discover who imprisoned him and why. The investigation — which the audience is invited to perform alongside the protagonist, assembling clues, forming hypotheses, anticipating the revelation — leads to a truth of such devastating specificity that discovering it becomes the ultimate punishment. Knowledge is not liberation — it is the instrument of the avenger's final cruelty. The investigative structure that Western narratives use to produce resolution (find the truth, achieve justice, restore order) is deployed as the mechanism of absolute destruction. The protagonist's active pursuit of knowledge is what enables his punishment; had he refused to investigate, the trap could not have closed. The audience, having performed the same investigation alongside him, is implicated in the trap's logic: we too wanted to know.

Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance deserves specific attention for its structural innovation: the film alternates sympathy between the two "sides" of its revenge plot (a deaf factory worker who kidnaps a child to pay for his sister's kidney transplant; the child's father who pursues revenge when the child accidentally dies). Neither side is wrong. Both sides' actions are comprehensible, even justifiable. The horror is that the revenge system, once activated, does not permit the rational adjudication that could prevent further violence. The system has its own logic, and that logic demands escalation regardless of the participants' moral status.

For PHANTASMATA: the narrative trap. Found-digital outputs invite investigation, reward it with revelations that retroactively contaminate everything assembled. The mock-post that, cross-referenced with other outputs, reveals a pattern the audience wishes they hadn't discovered. The video-log that, viewed in context supplied by earlier outputs, transforms from mundane to horrifying — not because the content changes but because the audience's knowledge changes, and the knowledge is the horror.

#### Bong Joon-ho: Architecture as Class Horror

The Host (2006): a river monster created by US military chemical dumping. A dysfunctional working-class family fights the creature while the government quarantines them and suppresses information. The real monster is not the creature but the system that created it and the system managing the response.

Parasite (2019): the definitive class-horror film. The Kim family (poor, living in a semi-basement that floods in heavy rain) infiltrates the Park family (wealthy, living in a modernist hilltop mansion) by one by one replacing the household staff — tutor, art therapist, driver, housekeeper. The scheme succeeds until the Kims discover that the previous housekeeper has been hiding her husband in a secret bunker beneath the house — a bunker the Kims did not know existed, revealing a class stratum below even their own.

The architectural structure of the Parks' house is the film's formal engine. The house is organized vertically: the Parks live on upper floors, the Kims operate at ground level, the hidden husband exists below ground. This vertical organization is a class diagram rendered in concrete and glass — physical position in the building indicates class position in society. The flood sequence makes the architectural metaphor literal: rain that merely dampens the Parks' garden party destroys the Kims' semi-basement home, because water flows downhill, from the wealthy hilltop to the impoverished lowland, and the physics of water is the physics of class.

The smell is Parasite's most radical formal contribution. The Parks notice that all the Kim family members share a distinct smell — the smell of their semi-basement, the smell of poverty, the smell of the environment class produces on the body. Mr. Park's involuntary recoil when he smells Mr. Kim is the film's most horrifying moment, because it reveals the class boundary that no amount of performance can cross. You can change clothes, forge credentials, learn the vocabulary and behaviors of a higher class. But the smell remains. The body betrays. The class marker is somatic, not behavioral, and therefore irreducible. For PHANTASMATA, this somatic class marker translates into the non-visual sensory dimension that found-digital formats can only reference obliquely — the text-fragment that mentions the smell of a space, the audio-log with ambient sound that implies a specific material environment, the video-log in which the subject's physical context (the walls, the ceiling height, the light quality) betrays their social position more eloquently than anything they say.

For PHANTASMATA: architectural horror. The built environment as physical manifestation of power structures. Video-logs where camera movement through space reveals a building's class logic. Mock-posts where descriptions of living situations gradually reveal architectural class embedding.

#### Train to Busan and I Saw the Devil

Train to Busan (Yeon Sang-ho, 2016): zombie film on a sealed high-speed train, where compartments become units of social negotiation — who is admitted, who locked out, who sacrifices, who hoards. The wealthy businessman who prioritizes survival by sealing compartments against others is the true villain — more dangerous than zombies because his behavior is strategic, rational, and socially sanctioned.

I Saw the Devil (Kim Jee-woon, 2010): a special agent whose fiancee is murdered by a serial killer captures, beats, and deliberately releases the killer repeatedly, wanting prolonged suffering rather than death. The extended game gives the killer opportunities to harm others, and the agent's obsession progressively destroys his humanity. The hunter becomes the devil. This maps onto $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS — obsession restructuring identity until indistinguishable from its object.

#### The Han Engine

Korean horror's emotional substrate is han (한) — accumulated grief and resentment, the psychic residue of historical suffering unaddressed and unresolved. Han is not individual emotion but collective inheritance — what remains when injustice is endured without redress. In J-horror, the ghost's motive is personal onnen. In Korean horror, the engine is collective, inherited, historical han that no specific redress can resolve. This is why Korean horror's endings tend bleaker: the horror cannot be resolved because it is not a single event but a condition.

For PHANTASMATA: horror that is structural rather than eventful — arising not from what happened but from the condition that makes what happened inevitable. Found-digital outputs documenting not a specific supernatural event but a general condition of accumulated, unaddressed suffering expressing itself as ambient dread. The video-log whose subject does not describe a haunting but lives within one — not a ghost that appears but a weight that persists, a sadness that saturates the space, a wrongness that has no origin because it is older than any individual experience. Han gives PHANTASMATA its model for horror without event: the condition that was there before the camera started recording and will be there after it stops.

### B4. Thai and Southeast Asian Horror: Animist Grammars

#### Shutter: The Spirit Photograph

Banjong Pisanthanakun's Shutter (2004): a photographer finds mysterious white shapes in photographs after a hit-and-run. The shapes resolve into the ghost of a woman he wronged. The climax reveals the ghost has been sitting on his shoulders throughout — the weight his neck pain indicated. The photograph as evidentiary horror: the camera shows what the eye cannot see. Spirit photography (real history: William Mumler's 1860s-70s "spirit photographs") translated into contemporary horror.

For PHANTASMATA: the screenshot with a figure not visible during recording. The video-log where playback reveals something the subject didn't see. The photo posted to social media with a face in a window, a shadow with wrong shape. The device sees what the eye does not, and the found-digital format — designed to be reviewed, paused, zoomed — makes the viewer investigator of their own evidence.

#### The Medium: Found-Footage Possession

Banjong Pisanthanakun's The Medium (2021): presented as documentary about a Thai shaman (Bayan) preparing her niece to inherit the spiritual role. The niece's "possession" becomes violent and uncontrollable. The documentary's clinical objectivity breaks down as events exceed the anthropological framework. The formal achievement: integration of found-footage convention with genuine cultural specificity. The possession is terrifying not because it violates Western rationalism but because it violates the rules of the tradition governing it — the goddess's possession should be benign, and instead it is savage and resistant to the shaman's authority.

For PHANTASMATA: found-footage horror gains power when the documentary frame genuinely engages real cultural practice. The found-digital output that begins as authentic documentation and allows horror to emerge from within the documented reality rather than imposed from outside.

#### Indonesian Horror: Islamic and Javanese Traditions

Joko Anwar's Satan's Slaves (2017) and Impetigore (2019) draw on the intersection of Islamic and Javanese supernatural traditions. Indonesia's syncretic landscape — Islam, Javanese kejawen, Hindu-Buddhist inheritance, local animism — generates a supernatural ecology of extraordinary complexity. The pocong (ghost in burial shroud), the sundel bolong (woman with hole in back), the tuyul (child-spirit enslaved to steal) derive horror from specific intersections of Islamic eschatology and Javanese spirit taxonomy.

Satan's Slaves: a family coping with their mother's death encounters supernatural intrusion that violates specifically Islamic prohibitions against communicating with the dead. Impetigore operates through Javanese wayang tradition: a village that must create shadow puppets from children's skins to lift a curse — the familiar cultural practice rendered monstrous through literal realization.

For PHANTASMATA: the most powerful supernatural horror draws on specific religious and cultural frameworks rather than generic "haunting" conventions. Found-digital outputs embedding horror in specific cultural practice gain the power of specificity — the sense that this horror belongs to a particular place, a particular community, a particular relationship between the living and the dead that cannot be generalized away. The syncretic dimension is especially valuable: horror that operates at the intersection of multiple belief systems cannot be contained by any single explanatory framework. The character who prays and the character who performs traditional ritual and the character who seeks medical help are all partially right and all insufficient, because the horror draws power from multiple systems simultaneously.

#### Filipino Horror: The Aswang and Embodied Transformation

The aswang — a shape-shifting creature that by day appears human and by night transforms into a predator — represents horror at the level of embodied transformation. The person next to you may not be a person. Erik Matti's Seklusyon (2016) situates this within Catholic seminary structure: deacons in seclusion before ordination discover that one among them is not what he appears. Filipino folk belief meeting Catholic institutional structure produces horror from friction between frameworks.

For PHANTASMATA: the horror of proximity — the entity sharing your space, your community. A found-digital output where one participant in a group (chat, video, document) is subtly wrong — messages at odd times, video feed glitching specifically, a behavior pattern others haven't recognized.

### B5. The Remake Pipeline and Cultural Translation

#### What Hollywood Took and Lost

The 2002-2008 period saw systematic acquisition and remaking of J-horror: The Ring (Verbinski, 2002), The Grudge (Shimizu himself, 2004), Dark Water (Salles, 2005). The Ring retains core mechanisms and adds Hollywood demands: higher budget, star performance, rationalized mythology, jump scares.

What is lost: the epistemological structure. In Ringu, the curse is irreducible — its mechanism cannot be rationalized, and the resolution (copying the tape and showing it to someone else) is not a solution but a perpetuation. The curse continues. There is no triumph, no mastery, no closure. In The Ring, the resolution is reframed as a grim but manageable problem — Rachel discovers what she must do to survive, the film ends on her performing that act, and the frame implies that the mystery, while dark, has been solved. The Western demand for narrative closure translates J-horror's epistemological horror (the investigation reveals that investigation is futile) into conventional thriller structure (the investigation reveals what must be done).

The Grudge, directed by Shimizu himself, preserved more of the original's formal DNA — non-linear structure, spatial-curse logic, bleak ending — but even Shimizu was compelled to add explanatory backstory, to smooth temporal dislocations, to provide the American audience with more narrative handholds. The industrial pressure toward intelligibility erodes J-horror's distinctive properties: its tolerance for ambiguity, its refusal to explain, its assumption that the audience's inability to comprehend the supernatural is not a defect but the horror itself.

The lesson for PHANTASMATA is not that cultural translation is impossible but that it must be performed at the level of formal principle rather than surface feature. What translates is not the specific ghost (Sadako, Kayako) but the structural logic (the curse that spreads through media, the space that contaminates through entry, the investigation that fails to resolve). PHANTASMATA can deploy J-horror's formal principles in non-Japanese contexts if the principles are extracted at the right level of abstraction — not "Japanese ghost with long hair" but "supernatural threat transmitted through the same medium the audience is using to consume the work."

#### The Reverse Flow

The more consequential cultural translation was not the remake pipeline but the influence pipeline — the gradual absorption of J-horror's formal principles into Western horror. James Wan's Insidious (2010) and The Conjuring (2013) incorporate J-horror's atmospheric approach (slow build, minimal gore, the supernatural as condition) into American haunted-house frameworks. David Robert Mitchell's It Follows (2014) is essentially Ringu's transmission-logic transplanted to an American setting and vector — the curse passes through sexual contact rather than viewing, but the structural logic is identical: the curse transmits person-to-person through an intimate act, the only "cure" is passing it to someone else, and the knowledge of the curse's approach (It Follows' entity walks toward you at constant speed, never stopping) produces the same temporal horror as Ringu's seven-day deadline.

Ari Aster's acknowledged debt to A Tale of Two Sisters in making Hereditary (2018) demonstrates the deepest influence level — structural, not stylistic. Hereditary does not look like a J-horror film. It operates like one: family home as psychic diagram, dual causality maintained without resolution, grief as the mechanism through which the supernatural enters the domestic, and rational resolution refused. The A24 horror movement — Aster, Robert Eggers, Jordan Peele — owes Asian horror a structural debt more fundamental than the remake pipeline's stylistic debt. These filmmakers did not borrow J-horror's visual grammar (long-haired ghosts, cursed technology). They borrowed its epistemological framework (horror as condition, knowledge as insufficient, the mundane as the supernatural's native habitat).

### B6. Contemporary Asian Horror

Kiyoshi Kurosawa continues extending J-horror vocabulary into new territory. Creepy (2016) returns to the domestic — a former detective moves to a new neighborhood and becomes suspicious of his neighbor — but the horror is entirely non-supernatural. The neighbor's behavior is wrong in ways that resist categorization: too friendly, too eager, responses to questions slightly off, his family too quiet. Kurosawa deploys the J-horror technique of atmospheric wrongness without any supernatural element, demonstrating that the technique's formal power does not depend on ghosts but on the epistemological condition the technique produces: the condition of knowing something is wrong without being able to identify what. Before We Vanish (2017) presents aliens that do not attack but absorb — they take human concepts (family, property, work, self) by removing them from individual minds, leaving humans diminished, simplified, stripped of the abstractions that make experience meaningful. The horror is conceptual: the aliens are not violent but reductive. For PHANTASMATA, this represents J-horror's evolution into a new register — horror produced not by supernatural presence but by conceptual absence.

Na Hong-jin's The Wailing (2016) deserves special mention as a late masterwork of Korean horror that synthesizes multiple traditions — J-horror atmosphere, Korean social specificity, shamanic ritual, Christian eschatology — into a film that is simultaneously a murder mystery, a possession narrative, a social satire, and a theological horror. The film's refusal to resolve its central question (who is the devil? who is the victim? which tradition's explanation is correct?) produces an epistemological vertigo that is the purest expression of the $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS axis: the audience cannot determine what they have witnessed even after the film ends.

The streaming era distributes Asian horror globally without the remake pipeline's mediation. Kingdom (Korean zombie-historical-political), Sweet Home (apartment monster-siege), All of Us Are Dead (high-school zombie social hierarchy), Ju-On: Origins (locating the curse's origin in 1980s Japanese social conditions) — all demonstrate that Asian horror's formal techniques scale from standalone films to serialized narratives without losing essential properties. The serialized format allows for narrative density the ninety-minute film cannot accommodate: Kingdom develops its political allegory across seasons, Sweet Home explores each apartment resident's transformation as a distinct horror variation, Ju-On: Origins roots the supernatural in thoroughly realized social history. The atmospheric approach, dual causality, social critique within supernatural framework — these function at any length and in any format, confirming availability for PHANTASMATA's multi-format output strategy.

## C) Techniques Inventory

Twenty formal techniques from Asian horror, each assessed for PHANTASMATA application.

---

**01: The Technological Ghost.** The ghost transmitting through media — tape, phone, internet, photograph. Technology is not neutral conduit but participant in the supernatural. *Horror function:* Collapses boundary between horror's delivery mechanism and diegetic mechanism. The audience performs the act the narrative identifies as lethal. *Examples:* Ringu, Pulse, One Missed Call, Shutter. *Format affinity:* All, especially video-log and screen-capture.

**02: The Curse as Contagion.** Supernatural threat spreading through contact (viewing, entering, touching) that cannot be resolved, only transmitted. *Horror function:* Transforms audience's relationship from consumption to exposure. Engaging with the work mirrors contracting the curse. *Examples:* Ringu, Ju-On, It Follows. *Format affinity:* Video-log, audio-log, mock-post — any format that can be "shared."

**03: The Long-Haired Apparition.** Female ghost rendered through yūrei grammar: long black hair obscuring face, white garment, disarticulated movement. *Horror function:* Dread through concealment. The audience dreads the face's revelation; withholding sustains dread across the entire runtime. *Examples:* Ringu, Ju-On, Dark Water, A Tale of Two Sisters. *Format affinity:* Video-log (figure at frame edge, hair obscuring face in low resolution).

**04: The Domestic Water Stain.** Mundane domestic deterioration — water damage, mold, appliance malfunction — as simultaneously naturalistic and supernatural. *Horror function:* Anchors the supernatural in everyday life. The mundane explanation's availability makes the supernatural explanation more unsettling. *Examples:* Dark Water, Parasite, A Tale of Two Sisters. *Format affinity:* Video-log (apartment problems), mock-post (tenant complaints becoming uncanny).

**05: The Non-Linear Grudge.** Scenes out of chronological order, reflecting the curse's non-temporal logic — radiating from origin in all temporal directions. *Horror function:* Prevents linear causal chain construction. Reconstruction reveals effects preceded causes. *Examples:* Ju-On, Noroi, Pulse. *Format affinity:* Multi-format series with inconsistent dates forcing timeline reconstruction.

**06: The Family as Prison.** Family generating horror through the intensity of its bonds — love and obligation as trapping mechanisms. *Horror function:* Horror from emotion the audience cannot categorize as negative. The horror is love, and love cannot be opposed. *Examples:* A Tale of Two Sisters, Parasite, The Host. *Format affinity:* Text-fragment, video-log — intimate formats representing family dynamics.

**07: The Architectural Class Diagram.** Architecture rendering class hierarchy literally — vertical building organization, hidden spaces, above/below relationships mapping social positions. *Horror function:* Makes class visible as spatial relationship, allowing horror through spatial mechanisms (flooding, descent, hidden-zone discovery). *Examples:* Parasite, Snowpiercer, Train to Busan. *Format affinity:* Video-log (building exploration revealing social structure), screen-capture (floor plans).

**08: The Spirit Photograph.** Photograph revealing supernatural presence invisible to naked eye. *Horror function:* Transforms the ordinary act of reviewing images into horror-investigation. The audience's habit of scrolling, zooming, scrutinizing becomes the discovery mechanism. *Examples:* Shutter, Noroi, Marebito. *Format affinity:* Mock-post (photos with anomalous elements), screen-capture (image review revealing hidden figures).

**09: The Genre Bait-and-Switch.** Work presenting as one genre for sustained duration, then transforming into horror, using trained expectations as vulnerability mechanism. *Horror function:* Disorientation that is structural rather than content-based. Genre expectations become the horror's access vector. *Examples:* Audition, Parasite, The Host. *Format affinity:* All formats — mock-post as personal update that transforms, video-log as mundane diary.

**10: The Animist Object.** Object treated as spiritually active entity capable of harboring supernatural presence — from Shinto tsukumogami and pan-Asian animist traditions. *Horror function:* Transforms audience's relationship to their devices. The found-digital format consumed on such a device activates animist logic. *Examples:* Ringu, Pulse, One Missed Call, The Medium. *Format affinity:* All found-digital formats — the format implies device participation.

**11: The Radical Slowness.** Scenes extended beyond comfort threshold — long takes, static cameras — producing distracted vigilance replicating digital browsing-state. *Horror function:* The horror manifests during the attention gap — quiet appearance that the viewer may or may not have noticed. Uncertainty about whether something happened is more disturbing than certainty. *Examples:* Pulse, Cure. *Format affinity:* Video-log (extended apparently-nothing footage), screen-capture (static screen with minimal activity).

**12: The Investigative Trap.** Structure inviting investigation that uses the investigation as delivery mechanism for horror — knowledge is not protection but weapon. *Horror function:* Transforms desire to understand into complicity. The audience sought the truth; the truth was designed to destroy. *Examples:* Oldboy, Ringu, Noroi. *Format affinity:* Multi-format series rewarding investigation with unwanted revelations.

**13: The Smell That Betrays.** Non-visual sensory markers (smell, sound, temperature) indicating class, supernatural presence, or hidden truth. *Horror function:* Exploits the gap between what the format can show and what the horror requires imagining. The imagination fills the gap with something worse. *Examples:* Parasite, Dark Water, Ju-On. *Format affinity:* Text-fragment (sensory descriptions), audio-log (sounds implying conditions).

**14: The Collective False Memory.** Multiple sources independently "remembering" something that may not have existed, with consistency serving as pseudo-evidence. *Horror function:* Horror is not the remembered thing but the condition of remembering — what does it mean that everyone agrees about something nonexistent? *Examples:* A Tale of Two Sisters, Noroi; cross-ref Candle Cove (Brief 02). *Format affinity:* Multi-format outputs from different "sources" corroborating shared experience.

**15: The Possession Documentary.** Found-footage documenting a possession or ritual that exceeds its documentary frame. Observers become participants; clinical objectivity breaks down. *Horror function:* The documentary frame's authority makes supernatural irruption more devastating. The form's failure to contain events produces epistemological crisis. *Examples:* The Medium, Noroi. *Format affinity:* Video-log (documentation overwhelmed by documented events).

**16: The Hidden Stratum.** Discovery within familiar space of a hidden zone — basement, bunker, sealed room — revealing concealed reality. The space was always there. *Horror function:* Retroactively contaminates the familiar space. Every moment spent above the hidden zone was unknowing proximity to concealed horror. *Examples:* Parasite, A Tale of Two Sisters, Satan's Slaves. *Format affinity:* Video-log (space exploration revealing hidden zones), text-fragment (spaces with concealed areas).

**17: The Temporal Wrongness.** Movement or behavior that is human but temporally displaced — too slow, too fast, reversed, stuttering. The body occupies a different time-signature than its environment. *Horror function:* Uncanniness through temporal rather than spatial distortion. Humans are calibrated to detect temporal anomalies in biological motion. *Examples:* Pulse, Ju-On, Ringu. *Format affinity:* Video-log (frame-rate anomalies, buffering affecting only certain figures).

**18: The Revenge Spiral.** Pursuing revenge progressively transforms the avenger into mirror-image of target. The pursuit is the transformation. *Horror function:* Horror from audience identification — supporting the revenge means complicity in the avenger's corruption. *Examples:* Oldboy, I Saw the Devil, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. *Format affinity:* Multi-format series documenting investigation that reveals the investigator's transformation.

**19: The Syncretic Supernatural.** Threat deriving power from intersection of multiple traditions (Islamic-Javanese, Catholic-animist), uncontainable by any single framework. *Horror function:* No single explanatory system can contain the horror. Every attempted solution addresses only one dimension. *Examples:* Satan's Slaves, Seklusyon, The Medium. *Format affinity:* Text-fragment, video-log referencing multiple frameworks without resolving into one.

**20: The Social Monster.** Literal monster as vehicle for social critique — existence literalizes a social condition. Both literally threatening and socially diagnostic. *Horror function:* Double register — audience fears physical threat and understands social symptom. Neither cancels the other; literal and social horror amplify each other. *Examples:* The Host, Train to Busan, Parasite. *Format affinity:* Video-log, mock-post documenting literal threat and the social conditions producing it.

## D) PHANTASMATA Application Notes

### D1. Director Dial Mappings

**$ARGENTO_GEL:** Asian horror's relationship is predominantly low — J-horror is desaturated, muted, the inverse of chromatic maximalism. However: Korean violence (Oldboy, I Saw the Devil) approaches operatic intensity; Joko Anwar's Indonesian horror uses bold lighting and ritual staging; the yūrei's white-on-dark is a chromatic system. The Medium's possession sequences register at $ARGENTO_GEL 40-55.

**$LYNCH_DRIFT:** J-horror maps powerfully. The core technique — mundane environment revealed as supernatural habitat — is precisely mundane anchor dissolution. Kiyoshi Kurosawa is closest to Lynch: Pulse's long takes, radical slowness, Tokyo as loneliness-city, hum-and-silence sonic palette. Dark Water's domestic dread maps $LYNCH_DRIFT's suburban dread to Japanese urban housing. A Tale of Two Sisters' identity blur maps Mulholland Drive territory.

**$KON_SPIRAL:** Named for Satoshi Kon — the dial most native to this constellation. Ringu's cursed tape is mediation collapse in purest form. Pulse extends it to the digital era. Shutter makes documentation the medium of revelation. Obsession recursion maps onto revenge structures where pursuit restructures identity.

### D2. Dial Recipes

**J-Horror Atmospheric** (Ringu, Dark Water, Pulse):
$ARGENTO_GEL: 5-15 | $LYNCH_DRIFT: 60-80 | $KON_SPIRAL: 50-70
Desaturated, long takes, minimal score. Mundane rendered wrong. Slow, quiet found-digital outputs accumulating wrongness through duration.

**Korean Social Horror** (Parasite, The Host, Train to Busan):
$ARGENTO_GEL: 20-35 | $LYNCH_DRIFT: 30-50 | $KON_SPIRAL: 25-45
Higher energy, narrative momentum, explicit social content. Architecture as class diagram. More narratively structured found-digital outputs.

**Korean Revenge Horror** (Oldboy, I Saw the Devil):
$ARGENTO_GEL: 45-65 | $LYNCH_DRIFT: 35-50 | $KON_SPIRAL: 55-75
Higher violence intensity, strong obsession recursion, narrative-trap structure. Investigative series rewarding investigation with contaminating revelations.

**Southeast Asian Animist** (The Medium, Satan's Slaves, Shutter):
$ARGENTO_GEL: 30-50 | $LYNCH_DRIFT: 40-60 | $KON_SPIRAL: 35-55
Ritual staging, atmospheric wrongness, documentary-frame collapse. Possession documentary: video/audio documenting cultural practice overwhelmed by supernatural dimension.

**J-Horror Digital** (Pulse, Marebito, streaming era):
$ARGENTO_GEL: 5-10 | $LYNCH_DRIFT: 70-85 | $KON_SPIRAL: 65-85
Maximum mediation collapse, maximum mundane dissolution. The most PHANTASMATA-native register: the found-digital format is the horror's operating system. The video-log recording a screen. The screen-capture of cursor movement on blank desktop. The horror is that the device is on and watching even when no one is watching it.

### D3. Format Compatibility Matrix

| Technique | video-log | screen-capture | audio-log | text-fragment | mock-post |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Technological Ghost | +++ | +++ | ++ | + | ++ |
| Curse as Contagion | +++ | ++ | ++ | ++ | +++ |
| Long-Haired Apparition | +++ | + | — | + | ++ |
| Domestic Water Stain | +++ | + | ++ | ++ | +++ |
| Non-Linear Grudge | ++ | ++ | ++ | +++ | ++ |
| Family as Prison | +++ | + | +++ | +++ | ++ |
| Architectural Class | +++ | ++ | + | ++ | + |

*Key:* +++ = native affinity; ++ = strong compatibility; + = usable with adaptation; — = minimal.

### D4. Axis Integration

**$GRINDHOUSE:** Asian horror's grindhouse intersection: Japanese pink violence/pinku eiga, Miike's extreme early work (Ichi the Killer), raw texture of original straight-to-video J-horror. Found-digital equivalent: video-logs with genuinely amateur production quality, not professionally degraded but raw.

**$GIALLO:** Minimal but present in Anwar's color work, Park Chan-wook's saturated palette, and the yūrei's chromatic white-on-black system.

**$LYNCH:** Kiyoshi Kurosawa is the bridge. Pulse is the definitive J-horror-as-Lynch text. PHANTASMATA outputs produce Lynchian effects through J-horror mechanisms: not compositional strangeness but technological wrongness, not dream-logic but media-logic.

**$FOUND_FOOTAGE:** Asian contributions — Noroi, Marebito, The Medium — provide models for found-footage rooted in culturally specific content rather than generic wilderness settings. Found footage gains power from specificity of what it documents.

**$PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS:** Explicitly Asian in origin — named for Kon's anime. A Tale of Two Sisters, Audition, Oldboy, and the yūrei's onnen-driven ghosts all operate here: madness, obsession, the blurring of psychological state and supernatural reality. This is the Asian horror constellation's native territory.

### D5. Key Extraction Principles

1. **Horror as condition, not event.** The J-horror curse does not happen; it is. Korean han does not occur; it persists. PHANTASMATA outputs should not build toward horror climax but establish a horror condition the audience inhabits.

2. **Knowledge does not save.** Investigate, discover, fail to resolve. The audience can assemble fragments and reconstruct timelines. Information accumulates. The horror continues.

3. **The device is the vector.** The device on which the audience consumes the work is structurally identical to the device through which the curse operates within the work.

4. **Dual causality is mandatory.** Every supernatural event has a mundane explanation. Every mundane explanation has a supernatural shadow. The oscillation between registers is the horror; resolving it ends it.

5. **Cultural specificity over generic supernatural.** Horror embedded in specific cultural, social, or architectural contexts is more powerful than generic haunting conventions.

6. **Architecture speaks.** Buildings are horror's formal engine. Vertical hierarchy, hidden zones, above/below relationships — space is meaning.

7. **The non-visual senses.** References to smell, temperature, texture create a gap between what the format shows and what the horror requires imagining. Imagination fills the gap with something worse.

8. **The ghost approaches; it does not attack.** Pulse's great formal lesson: the ghost that slowly approaches, needy rather than aggressive, pathetic rather than powerful, is more disturbing than the ghost that attacks. The PHANTASMATA output should not culminate in violence but in proximity — the moment when the distance between the horror and the audience collapses to zero, and the horror simply stands there, present, close, wanting something it can never articulate.

9. **The inhabitation model over the malfunction model.** J-horror's animist framework treats haunted technology as occupied rather than broken. PHANTASMATA's devices should feel inhabited — not glitching in generic horror-movie ways but behaving as if something is present in the machine, using the machine's native functions (notifications, timestamps, auto-corrections) as its mode of expression.

10. **The share is the curse.** Ringu's propagation logic — the curse spreads through the act of sharing the tape — maps perfectly onto the viral mechanics of social media. When a PHANTASMATA output is shared by an audience member, the share structurally replicates the curse's transmission vector. Design outputs that become more unsettling when shared, that accumulate power through distribution, that perform the act of being passed from person to person as the horror's own propagation.

11. **Time folds, does not flow.** Ju-On's non-chronological structure reflects a curse that does not respect linear time. PHANTASMATA's multi-format output series should not assume that the audience will encounter outputs in order. Design each output to function both as standalone fragment and as piece of a non-linear whole whose temporal logic is the curse's logic, not the calendar's.
