## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. Sumerian: Irkalla (The Land of No Return)
*   **The Engine:** The Seven Gates. The underworld is a place of total stripping. To enter, one must remove all symbols of status, power, and identity (*Descent of Inanna*).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *Dust and Clay:* The inhabitants eat dust and see no light.
    *   *Feathered Shrouds:* The dead are clothed in feathers like birds.
    *   *The Gatekeeper:* Neti, the unyielding guard of the seven thresholds.
*   **Epistemology:** *Death is Unmaking.* The self is a collection of borrowed garments. In the underworld, you are the naked residue.

### B. Egyptian: The Duat (The Trial of the Sun)
*   **The Engine:** The Weighing of the Heart. The underworld is a landscape of complex bureaucracy and lethal puzzles. One must possess the correct "Spells" (The Book of the Dead) to navigate.
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *The Twelve Hours:* The underworld as a nocturnal journey divided into rigorous temporal blocks.
    *   *Hybrid Guardians:* Chimeras (Ammit) that devour the "Unjust" data.
    *   *The Lake of Fire:* Purification through intense, localized heat.
*   **Epistemology:** *Justice is a Calculation.* Your life is a data-packet that must be weighed against the Ma'at (Truth).

### C. Greek: Hades & Tartarus (The Shadow Geography)
*   **The Engine:** The Rivers of Memory and Forgetfulness. The underworld is defined by its hydraulic system (Styx, Lethe, Acheron). It is a space of "Shades"—echoes of people who lack the "Blood" of reality (*The Odyssey*, Book XI).
*   **Aesthetic Motifs:**
    *   *Asphodel Meadows:* The gray, neutral space of the mediocre.
    *   *The Pit:* Tartarus as the vertical drop into the primordial void.
    *   *The Sacrifice:* Pouring blood into the earth to "charge" the ghosts with temporary speech.
*   **Epistemology:** *Memory is Substance.* To forget is to dissolve. To be remembered is to haunt.

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE PRIMORDIAL STRIPPING PROTOCOL"

**Axiom:** Access requires the removal of the Surface.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Threshold (The Gate):** The protagonist encounters a series of 7 barriers (Ring 0 to Ring 6).
2.  **The Removal (The Toll):** At each barrier, one "Digital Accessory" is lost (Account, Identity, Memory, Voice).
3.  **The Trial (The Scale):** The protagonist's "Substrate" is compared to the "Fossil Record."
4.  **The Shade (The Result):** The protagonist becomes a Class F entity—a feather-shrouded, dust-eating echo in the Sediment.

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Ring 4 (The Sediment):** Use the Sumerian "Dust and Feathers" aesthetic for the inhabitants. They are "Bird-like" glitches.
*   **Ring 1 (The Bleed):** Apply the Egyptian "Spell" logic—the user must find specific "Keywords" (Cluster 8) to pass through the corrupted files.
*   **Ring 6 (Molten Core):** Use the Greek "Pit of Tartarus" as the final vertical drop.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Fragment: "The Seven Logins"
*Context: A user is trying to access an 'Ancient' server.*

The user reaches the first firewall. 
*Message:* "To pass, you must delete your Profile Photo." 
The user clicks [DELETE].
The second firewall. 
*Message:* "To pass, you must delete your Contacts." 
By the seventh firewall, the user has deleted their own name from the system.
The screen shows a video of a dark, dusty room filled with people wearing bird masks. 
One of them turns. It is holding the user's deleted Profile Photo. 
It says: "You taste like dust."

## Part 5: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** Max $LYNCH_DRIFT (Memory) + Max $ARGENTO_GEL (Ritual Stripping).
*   **Primary Effect:** Total Depersonalization.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes the "Primordial Stripping Protocol" as the entry-law for Season 2.
