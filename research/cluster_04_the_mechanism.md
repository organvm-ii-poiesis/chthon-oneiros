## Part 1: Analysis & Synthesis (Steps 4-13)

### A. John Carpenter: The Unstoppable Shape
*   **The Engine:** The Presence of Evil as Object. Evil is not a person; it is a "Shape" or a "Fog" that occupies space (*Halloween*, *The Thing*, *The Fog*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *The Panaglide/Steadicam POV:* The unblinking, smooth gaze of the predator.
    *   *Deep Focus in Panavision:* The threat is visible in the extreme background while the victim is in the foreground.
    *   *Negative Space:* The horror lives in the empty corners of the frame.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Siege. A group is trapped in a location (a house, a station, an Antarctic base) while an external/internal force systematically picks them off.
*   **Epistemology:** *Evil is Persistent.* It doesn't need a motive; it only needs a location.

### B. Wes Craven: The Meta-Nightmare
*   **The Engine:** The Rules of the Genre. Horror is self-aware. The characters know they are in a horror story, but knowledge does not save them (*A Nightmare on Elm Street*, *Scream*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *The Threshold:* Dreams and reality bleeding together (the hand in the bathtub).
    *   *The Phone Call:* The voice of the predator invading the private domestic space.
    *   *The Trap:* Elaborate mechanical or narrative traps.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Deconstruction. The story critiques its own tropes while simultaneously executing them.
*   **Epistemology:** *The Map is the Territory.* Our collective fear of horror stories *creates* the horror.

### C. Tobe Hooper: The Visceral Decay
*   **The Engine:** The Industrial Meat-Grinder. Horror is the collapse of civilization into pure, sweaty, mechanical slaughter (*The Texas Chain Saw Massacre*, *Poltergeist*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *Low-Angle Aggression:* The camera looking up at the predator/tool.
    *   *Industrial Noise:* The chainsaw, the hum of the generator, the sound of machinery.
    *   *The Sun-Drenched Rot:* Horror that happens in broad daylight, stripping away the safety of the dark.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Abduction. Moving from the safety of the road into the "Dead Zone" where laws no longer apply.
*   **Epistemology:** *Man is Meat.* Beneath the social contract is the hook and the blade.

### D. Alfred Hitchcock: The Voyeuristic Guilt
*   **The Engine:** The Gaze. The horror is in the act of watching and the guilt of being seen (*Psycho*, *Rear Window*, *The Birds*).
*   **Visual Motifs:**
    *   *The Subjective POV:* The camera becomes the eyes of the character (or the killer).
    *   *The MacGuffin:* An object that drives the plot but has no inherent value.
    *   *The Montage:* The "Shower Scene" logic—the kill is constructed in the mind of the viewer through rapid cuts.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The Suspense. The audience knows the bomb is under the table; the characters do not.
*   **Epistemology:** *Knowledge is Dangerous.* Seeing the crime makes you an accomplice.

## Part 2: The Framework Schema (Step 14)

### System Name: "THE PREDATORY MECHANISM"

**Axiom:** The rules are the only thing that is real.
**Mechanism:**
1.  **The Observation:** The victim is identified through a "Gaze" (The Hitchcock POV).
2.  **The Notification:** The victim is informed of their status (The Craven Phone Call).
3.  **The Siege:** The victim is isolated within a geometric space (The Carpenter Frame).
4.  **The Processing:** The victim is converted from "Subject" to "Material" (The Hooper Meat-Grinder).

## Part 3: Framework Application (Step 15)

**How to use in PHANTASMATA:**
*   **Giallo Axis:** Use Hitchcock's montage and Carpenter's wide frames to make the "Black-Gloved Killer" feel like a function of the camera itself.
*   **Found-Footage:** Use Craven's meta-logic—the video file knows it's being watched.
*   **Ring 2 (City of Gels):** Use Hooper's industrial sound design to contrast with the beautiful visuals.

## Part 4: Framework Example (Step 16)

### Fragment: "The Subscriber"
*Context: A user is watching a livestream of an empty hallway.*

The user is the only viewer of a stream titled `LOBBY_CAM_04`.
The stream has a chat box. 
A message appears from `SYSTEM`: "You are now the Primary Witness."
The camera (Carpenter-style smooth pan) begins to follow a resident walking to their mail.
The user tries to close the tab. 
The browser displays a Hitchcock-style close-up of an eye. 
The eye is the user's own webcam feed. 
Text appears on screen: **"DON'T LOOK AWAY. YOU ARE HOLDING THE BLADE."**
As the resident on screen is attacked, the user feels the weight of a heavy, leather-bound object in their own hand.

---

## Part 5: Refinement (Step 17)

*Critique:* "Holding the blade" is too literal.
*Refinement:* Instead of holding a physical blade, the user's mouse cursor on the screen becomes the "Razor." Everywhere they click, the video feed "Cuts" and bleeds.
*Epistemology:* The act of interacting with the interface is the act of violence ($KON).

## Part 6: Final Documentation (Step 18)

*   **Dial:** High $ARGENTO_GEL (The Kill) + High $KON_SPIRAL (Interface Violence).
*   **Primary Effect:** Voyeuristic Guilt.
*   **Legacy:** Establishes "The Predatory Mechanism" as the logic for the Week 8 Climax.
