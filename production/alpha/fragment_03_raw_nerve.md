## TRANSCRIPT

**[00:00]**
(Heavy breathing. Wet coughing. The audio quality is terrible—clipped, distorted, like the microphone is covered in cloth or fluid.)

**VOICE (Male, panicked):**
"It's in the wall. I swear to god, it's in the pipes."

**(Sound of metal banging on metal. *CLANG. CLANG. CLANG.*)**

**VOICE:**
"They said it was water hammer. It's not water. Water doesn't scream."

**[00:45]**
(A low frequency HUM begins. It starts at 40Hz and slowly slides down. It vibrates the microphone diaphragm.)

**VOICE:**
"There. There it is. Do you hear it? It tastes like... copper."

**(Sound of dry retching.)**

**VOICE:**
"I tried to cut the pipe. I used the saw. I just wanted to see."

**[01:30]**
(Squishing sound. Like walking in mud.)

**VOICE:**
"It wasn't water. It was... teeth. The pipe is full of teeth."

**(A loud, piercing SHRIEK tears through the audio. It sounds mechanical and biological at the same time. The waveform clips to a square wave.)**

**VOICE:**
(Screaming) "IT'S BITING THE SAW! IT'S BITING THE—"

**(Audio cuts to static.)**

## ANALYSIS
*   **Anomaly:** Biological material in mechanical infrastructure.
*   **Epistemology:** Physical violation. The mundane home infrastructure becomes a body ($GRINDHOUSE).
*   **Dial Check:** Visceral, ugly, immediate. No dream logic, just pain.
