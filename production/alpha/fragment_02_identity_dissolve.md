## VISUAL DESCRIPTION

**IMAGE 1: The Desktop**
A standard macOS desktop. Wallpaper is a default landscape.
Open windows:
1.  Browser (Chrome): Tab open to a social media profile (Instagram-alike).
2.  TextEdit document: "Notes for Dr. Aris."

**IMAGE 2: The Discovery**
The user is scrolling through a profile named `@echo_locator_real`.
The profile photo is identical to the user's current webcam feed (visible in a small PIP window).
*Anomaly:* The photos on the profile show the user doing things they haven't done yet.
*   Photo 1: User eating at a diner. Date stamp: "Tomorrow."
*   Photo 2: User sleeping in their bed. Angle: From the ceiling.

**IMAGE 3: The Message**
The user opens the DM window to `@echo_locator_real`.
User types: "Who are you?"
The typing bubble appears immediately.
Reply: "I'm you. You're the backup."

**IMAGE 4: The Glitch**
The webcam PIP window flickers.
In the PIP, the user freezes. But the user's mouse cursor is still moving on the desktop.
The user in the webcam *looks at the cursor*. They are watching the screen *from the inside*.

**IMAGE 5: The Desktop Wallpaper**
The wallpaper changes. It is no longer a landscape.
It is a photo of the user, sitting at this computer, taken from *behind* the chair.
The user turns the webcam to look behind them.
The room is empty.
The screen goes black.

## ANALYSIS
*   **Anomaly:** Temporal contamination (future photos). Mediation collapse (Webcam user becomes autonomous).
*   **Epistemology:** The user is not the "Real" version. Identity is dissolved.
*   **Dial Check:** The screen is the monster ($KON). The mundane anchor (desktop) dissolved ($LYNCH).
