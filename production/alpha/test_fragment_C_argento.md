## CONTENT DESCRIPTION

**LOCATION:** A deserted apartment complex. The hallway is lined with mirrors.

**LIGHTING:** The primary light source is a single, cracked skylight. But the light falling through it is a thick, viscous EMERALD GREEN. The shadows are not black; they are a deep, bruised VIOLET.

**ACTION:**
A woman in a white silk nightgown runs down the hall. Her bare feet make no sound on the tiles. 
She stops. In every mirror, her reflection is different.
*   Mirror 1: She is standing still.
*   Mirror 2: She is weeping.
*   Mirror 3: She is missing her eyes.

**THE ARRIVAL:**
At the end of the hall, a door opens. 
A figure emerges. Black leather trench coat. Black leather gloves. 
The figure holds a silver straight razor. The metal catches the green light and reflects it as a blinding, impossible RED.

**THE KILL:**
The figure moves with the grace of a dancer. It is not a chase; it is a choreography. 
The music swells—a pounding, 7/4 time signature synth-bass with a screaming operatic soprano.
The woman is cornered against a mirror.
The killer reaches out. The razor doesn't cut her throat. It cuts the *reflection* of her throat in the mirror.

**THE PAYOFF:**
Blood begins to pour from the mirror's surface. It is the color of a neon sign—glowing, electric CRIMSON.
The woman collapses, clutching her throat, even though she hasn't been touched.
The killer wipes the razor. The emerald light turns to a blinding GOLD.
The scene freezes. The image becomes a high-contrast poster.

## ANALYSIS
*   **Anomaly:** Chromatic aggression (Light as force). Sympathetic magic (Mirror kill).
*   **Epistemology:** Beauty and violence are indistinguishable. The visual field dictates physical reality.
*   **Dial Check:** Maximum aestheticization ($ARGENTO). The ritual is the narrative.
