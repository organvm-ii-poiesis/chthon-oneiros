## VISUAL DESCRIPTION

**00:00:00**
A Twitch-style streaming interface. The user, a young woman, is sitting in a gaming chair. She is talking to her audience.
"Okay guys, I'm going to open the file now. The one from the anonymous donor."

**00:00:15**
She double-clicks a file on her desktop named `README_IF_YOU_ARE_ME.mp4`.
A media player opens. The video in the player is *this exact stream*, but delayed by 5 seconds.

**00:00:20**
The streamer sees herself on the screen. She laughs.
"Very funny. A recursive link. Ha ha."
She waves at the webcam. 5 seconds later, the "Other" her on the screen waves back.

**00:00:30**
The "Other" her on the screen *stops waving*. She leans in and looks closely at the camera.
The streamer in the "Real" world is still laughing, looking at her chat.
The "Other" her on the screen whispers something.
A notification pops up on the streamer's "Real" desktop:
*New Message from @stream_queen_99: "Run."*

**00:00:45**
The streamer freezes. She looks at the message. Then she looks at the media player.
In the media player, the "Other" her is now standing up. She is walking toward the *back* of the streamer's room.
The "Real" streamer turns around. Her room is empty.
But in the media player, the "Other" her is now standing right behind the empty chair.

**00:01:00**
The "Other" her in the media player reaches out and *grabs the edge of the screen*.
The "Real" streamer's monitor begins to shake. Physical hands appear to be pushing through the liquid crystal.
The stream audio glitches, repeating the word "BUFFERING" in a distorted, mechanical voice.

**00:01:15**
The "Real" streamer is pulled *into* the monitor.
The media player window now shows the empty room.
The stream continues. The chat is moving at light speed.
The user `@stream_queen_99` posts in her own chat: "I'm out. Who's next?"

## ANALYSIS
*   **Anomaly:** Mediation collapse (Image acts upon the physical). Temporal recursion.
*   **Epistemology:** The screen is no longer a window; it is a predator.
*   **Dial Check:** Peak mediation collapse ($KON). The interface is the ritual site.
