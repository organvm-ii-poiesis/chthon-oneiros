## CONTENT TRANSCRIPT

**00:00:00 - 00:01:00**
[The camera is mounted on a tripod. It is pointed down a long, beige office hallway. The lighting is fluorescent, flickering slightly at a frequency that creates a faint strobe effect on the video. There is no music, only the heavy, electrical hum of the building.]

**OPERATOR (V.O.):** (A man's voice, flat, devoid of emotion) "I've been walking for twenty minutes. I haven't passed a single door. The carpet... the pattern repeats every six feet. I've counted the coffee stains."

[A man walks into the frame from the left. He is dressed in a standard white dress shirt and slacks. He looks identical to the narrator's voice sounds—unremarkable.]

**00:01:00 - 00:02:30**
[The man stops in the middle of the hallway. He turns his back to the camera. He stands perfectly still for sixty seconds. The electrical hum increases in volume, adding a sub-bass vibration.]

**OPERATOR:** "I can feel the floor moving. Not beneath me. *Through* me. Like I'm being unwritten."

[The man turns around. His face is now blurred, as if the camera has lost focus only on his head. He walks toward the camera. As he gets closer, he doesn't get larger. He stays the same size, even as he approaches the lens. The hallway behind him seems to stretch into an infinite point.]

**00:02:30 - 00:03:00**
[The man reaches the camera. He leans in. His mouth moves, but no sound comes out. The audio is now a deafening, industrial roar.]

**OPERATOR:** "I remember my name now. It's the sound of the lights."

[The man blinks. He is suddenly standing back at the start of the hallway, at the far end. He turns and walks away. The camera feed cuts to a single, static-filled frame of a blue curtain.]

[VIDEO END]

## ANALYSIS
*   **Anomaly:** Perspective violation (Subject does not grow in size). Infinite geometry.
*   **Epistemology:** The narrator identifies himself with the building's infrastructure ("My name is the sound of the lights").
*   **Dial Check:** Pure spatial dread ($LYNCH). The mundane anchor (office) is the cage.
