## I. THE SORTING (00:00 - 05:00)
A screen-capture of a file management utility. 
The user is dragging files into a folder named **"ARCHIVE."**
*Note:* The cursor is leaving a trail of charcoal on the screen (Goya motif). 
Suddenly, the "Archive" folder begins to expand. 
It grows until it covers the entire desktop. 
The icons for the user's files don't disappear; they transform into small, 3D representations of rooms.

## II. THE GRAND ARCHITECTURE (05:00 - 10:00)
The user (handheld footage) walks through their living room. 
The walls are no longer drywall. They are made of **Obsidian and Gold** (Miltonic Pandemonium).
The ceiling has risen to an impossible height, disappearing into a bruised, VIOLET haze ($ARGENTO bonus).
The lighting is "Darkness Visible"—it provides no clarity, only the sensation of vastness.
The sound is a distant, operatic choir mixed with the hum of millions of server fans.

## III. THE CONTRAPASSO (10:00 - 15:00)
The user reaches a balcony. 
Below them is a Bosch-style menagerie of "Processed" data. 
They see their own "Deleted" files as physical entities. 
*   A "Class A" Glitch entity is being "Sorted" by a giant, black-gloved hand.
*   A "Class E" Throat-Pipe is being used as a trumpet by a faceless crowd.
The user realizes the "Archive" is not storage. It is **Consumption**.

## IV. THE LIBRETTO (15:00 - 20:00)
The user's phone vibrates. 
*Message from @the_director:* "Your role has been assigned. Please take your place in the Grid."
The user looks at their own feet. They are turning into **Concrete**. 
They are becoming a load-bearing column in the architecture of Pandemonium. 
The camera pans up to show the "Omniscient Grid" of the entire Underworld—a perfectly symmetrical city of gold and meat.

**[SYSTEM]: Categorization complete. You are the Canon.**
