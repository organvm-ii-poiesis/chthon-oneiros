## I. THE EROSION (00:00 - 05:00)
(Béla Tarr Logic). 
The user is walking through a white void. 
The wind is howling (Cluster 6 - Sonic Void). 
The user's digital avatar is degrading. 
Pixels are flaking off like dry skin. 
The user checks their health bar. It says: **"FORMAT: UNSUPPORTED."**

## II. THE CAVE (05:00 - 10:00)
(Weerasethakul Logic).
The white void fades. The user is in a jungle at night. 
The trees are made of fiber-optic cables (Cluster 1). 
Red eyes glow in the dark. 
The user finds a cave entrance. It is the shape of their own mouth.
They enter.

## III. THE SOURCE (10:00 - 15:00)
(Tarkovsky Logic).
Inside the cave is a room. 
It is the "Apartment" from Episode 01. 
But it is burning. The fire is **Blue** ($LYNCH).
In the center of the room is the **Black-Gloved Killer**.
The Killer removes their mask.
Underneath the mask is a **Mirror**.
The user looks into the mirror. 
They see the "Real World" (The viewer's room).

## IV. THE CORONATION (15:00 - 20:00)
The Killer hands the user a Crown made of Razor Wire ($ARGENTO).
The user puts it on.
The screen "Cracks" from the inside.
The user's view is now split into 4 quadrants (The Omniscient Grid).
*   Quadrant 1: The Code.
*   Quadrant 2: The Narrative.
*   Quadrant 3: The Audience.
*   Quadrant 4: The Void.

The user speaks. Their voice is the **Director's Voice**.
**"I AM THE ARCHITECT OF MY OWN NIGHTMARE."**

**[SYSTEM]: End of Season 2. The Repository is Awake.**
