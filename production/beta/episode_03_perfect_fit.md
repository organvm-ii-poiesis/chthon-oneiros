## I. THE DISCOVERY (00:00 - 05:00)
The scene is a public parking garage in "The City of Gels." 
The lighting is an aggressive, flickering VERMILION. 
The protagonist, "The Tenant," is looking for their car. 
They find a section of the concrete wall that is bulging. 
The concrete has the texture of wet skin. It is bruising INDIGO where the rebar pokes through.

## II. THE FOSSIL (05:00 - 10:00)
The Tenant approaches the wall. 
There is a hollow in the concrete. 
It is not a random crack. It is a silhouette. 
A perfect negative space in the shape of a human body, mid-stride. 
The Tenant realizes the dimensions are identical to their own. 
The "Acoustic Flesh" (Cluster 6) is loud here—a wet, suction-like sound coming from the hole.

## III. THE FIT (10:00 - 15:00)
The Tenant feels a Barker-esque compulsion (Cluster 9). 
They aren't afraid. They feel a "Homecoming." 
They turn around and press their back into the concrete silhouette. 
The fit is perfect. 
The concrete is warm. It begins to move. 
The edges of the silhouette start to close over the Tenant's chest like a mouth.

## IV. THE INTEGRATION (15:00 - 20:00)
The screen quality degrades to 240p (Kurosawa logic). 
The Tenant's face is the last thing visible before the concrete seals. 
They aren't screaming. They are smiling. 
The "Omniscient Grid" symmetry is achieved. 
The parking garage is now a "Load-Bearing" body.

**[SYSTEM]: Integration complete. You are the Building.**
