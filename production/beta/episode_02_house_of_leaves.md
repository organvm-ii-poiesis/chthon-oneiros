## I. THE DISCREPANCY (00:00 - 05:00)
A screen-capture of a standard real estate listing. 
Title: "Luxury Apartment - Zero Geometric Resistance."
The user is clicking through the 3D tour. 
They notice a door in the laundry room that wasn't in the floor plan. 
They click the door. 
The 3D tour glitches. The URL in the address bar begins to grow longer, adding subdirectories that make no sense:
`apartment.com/unit-4b/hallway/hallway/hallway/void/fossil`

## II. THE MEASUREMENT (05:00 - 10:00)
The user (handheld phone footage) walks into their real laundry room. 
They hold a tape measure. 
The room is 6 feet wide. 
They look at the screen of their laptop. The 3D tour says the room is 6.0000000001 feet wide. 
As they watch, the decimal point moves. 
The room on the screen is now 100 feet wide. 
The user turns around. Their physical laundry room is now a dark, concrete tunnel that stretches past the limit of their phone's flashlight.

## III. THE FOSSIL (10:00 - 15:00)
The user walks down the tunnel. 
The sound is the "Acoustic Flesh"—the wet thrumming of the building's heart. 
They find a Class F Fossil in the wall. 
It is a shape of a person mid-scream, perfectly carved into the concrete. 
The user touches the face of the fossil. 
The concrete is warm. It has a pulse. 

The phone battery drops to 1%. 
The user tries to turn back. 
The hallway behind them is now a mirror. 
The reflection shows the user standing in their original laundry room, looking at their phone. 
The "Real" user is now the one inside the concrete.
