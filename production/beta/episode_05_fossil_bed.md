## I. THE DESCENT (00:00 - 05:00)
The visual is a "Begotten" style high-contrast monochrome (Cluster 11). 
The user is descending a staircase that doesn't have steps—it has **Ribs**. 
The sound is the "Infrasound" (Cluster 6)—a pressure so heavy it makes the camera lens shake. 
Every 10 seconds, the image quality drops, from 1080p to 480p to 240p to a single pixel. 
The single pixel is **Argento Red**.

## II. THE BED (05:00 - 10:00)
The user reaches the bottom. This is **Ring 5: The Fossil Bed**. 
The floor is made of solid, unpainted concrete. 
But the concrete is transparent. 
Beneath the surface, the user sees thousands of "Class F" Fossils—human shapes packed tightly together like a reef. 
They are all looking up at the user. 
The user's own flashlight (on their phone) reflects off the concrete, showing the user's face in every fossil's eyes.

## III. THE COMPRESSION (10:00 - 15:00)
The non-Euclidean logic of the room activates (Cluster 7). 
The user walks forward, but the wall moves with them. 
The distance between the user and the fossils is constant. 
The "Metallic Fever" (Cluster 11) begins. The user's phone starts to heat up. 
It melts into the user's hand. 
The screen of the phone displays a "Connection Speed" of **0.0 bits/s**. 
The user's own pulse is displayed as the only remaining metric of reality.

## IV. THE FINAL FIT (15:00 - 20:00)
The user finds the silhouette from Episode 03 ("The Perfect Fit"). 
It is waiting for them in the floor. 
The user lies down in the hollow. 
The compression is total. 
The visual feed cuts to a "Raw Signal"—a pulsating white noise that contains the user's own birth date and death date. 
The "Acoustic Flesh" (Cluster 6) whispers: **"RECUR. RECUR. RECUR."**

The final frame is a 0kb file named `inheritance.void`. 

**[SYSTEM]: Compression complete. You are the Sediment.**
