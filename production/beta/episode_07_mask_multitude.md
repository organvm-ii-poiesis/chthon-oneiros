## I. THE PERSONA (00:00 - 05:00)
A screen-capture of a profile creation screen for a new app called **"SELF_PORTRAIT."**
The user is uploading a photo of their face. 
The app has a "Verification" step. 
*Message:* "Please look into the camera and smile. Hold for 10 seconds."
The user (PIP webcam) smiles. They look into the lens. 
The app progress bar reaches 99% and stops.
*Message:* **"ERROR: Too many masks detected. Please remove the Persona."**

## II. THE SLIPPAGE (05:00 - 10:00)
The user tries to refresh the app. 
The photo on the screen begins to change. 
It isn't a glitch. It is a **Rotation**. 
The face in the photo turns its head to the side, looking at something off-screen.
The user's real face (webcam) is still looking forward. 
A voice (Bergman close-up logic) whispers: "I'm tired of the smile. Let's see what's behind the teeth."

## III. THE SHADOW (10:00 - 15:00)
The screen quality drops to a high-contrast Merhige grain (Cluster 11). 
The "Shadow" of the user on the wall behind them becomes an independent object. 
It isn't a silhouette; it is a **Void**. 
The Shadow reaches for the user's chair. 
The user (handheld phone footage) runs to the bathroom. 
They look into the mirror ($KON bonus). 
They don't see their own face. They see a **Multitude**. 
Thousands of different faces—some from the Museum (Episode 02), some from the Research (Cluster 3)—all flashing across the glass in 1/24th of a second.

## IV. THE CORONATION (15:00 - 20:00)
The user picks up a razor ($ARGENTO). 
They don't cut their skin. They cut the air in front of their face. 
The "Persona" (a thin, plastic-like film) peels away. 
The final image is a "Raw Signal" of the user's face without features. 
No eyes. No mouth. Just a pulsating screen.
The voice of the Director (Week 12) says: **"Thou art observed by the Subconscious."**

**[SYSTEM]: Verification complete. Welcome to the Underworld.**
