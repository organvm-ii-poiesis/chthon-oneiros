## I. THE VIBRATION (00:00 - 05:00)
A screen-capture of a network diagnostic tool. 
Target: `localhost/brain`.
The ping latency is fluctuating in a rhythmic pattern: 60ms, 60ms, 120ms...
The user (handheld footage) is sitting in their living room. 
The floor is vibrating. It's not a machine hum; it's a **Pulse**. 
The user peels back a section of the carpet. 
Beneath the floorboards, they find a bundle of translucent, fiber-optic cables. 
The cables are pulsating with a thick, violet fluid.

## II. THE NERVE (05:00 - 10:00)
The user touches one of the cables. 
Immediate feedback: The screen-capture on the laptop spikes to 1000% CPU usage. 
The user's own arm begins to glow with the same violet light. 
They realize the cables aren't just under the floor; they are connected to the user's chair, their desk, and their keyboard. 
The "Acoustic Flesh" (Cluster 6) becomes a roar of data. 
The "Infectious Phoneme" (Cluster 8) is heard in the vibration: **"SYNC. SYNC. SYNC."**

## III. THE HEART (10:00 - 15:00)
The user follows the cables to the wall. 
The wall is bruising (Class E - Wall-Skin). 
A section of the drywall peels away, revealing a massive, biological pump. 
It looks like a human heart, but it is made of server racks and cooling fans. 
The heart is beating at the same rate as the user's pulse. 
The user realizes they are not the tenant; they are the **Battery**.

## IV. THE UPLOAD (15:00 - 20:00)
The camera drops. 
The user is seen crawling toward the heart. 
They aren't running away. They are trying to "Plug In." 
The violet fluid begins to leak from the user's eyes and mouth. 
The final frame is a Hitchcock-style zoom into the user's eye. 
Inside the pupil, we see the entire "Omniscient Grid" of the city, glowing in Argento Red.

**[SYSTEM]: Sync complete. Circulation established.**
