## I. THE SURFACE (00:00 - 05:00)
The episode begins with a screen-capture of a construction dashboard. 
The project is "THE HEART REHABILITATION." 
A robotic voice narrates the sensor data: *Temperature: 15C. Depth: 200m. Status: Stable.*

The UI is a perfect **Omniscient Grid**. 
Suddenly, the drill head slows down. 
The torque sensor spikes to **CRITICAL**.
The audio from the borehole (Acoustic Pressure) is not the sound of rock. 
It is the sound of a human throat clearing itself. *Ahem.*

## II. THE BREACH (05:00 - 10:00)
The visual cuts to a remote-operated vehicle (ROV) feed. 
We are at the bottom of the borehole. 
The walls of the hole are galvanized steel pipes. 
But they are bruised. Deep violet hematomas cover the metal.

The drill hits a "Cable-Nerve." 
It is a thick, pulsating tube the size of a train tunnel. 
As the drill bites in, the audio feed from the ROV explodes into a Hildur-esque industrial scream.
The "Blood" from the nerve is not liquid. It is **Data**. 
Millions of `.txt` files stream out of the wound, visible as white lines in the dark water.

## III. THE SUBSIDENCE (10:00 - 15:00)
The camera pans up. 
The borehole is collapsing. 
But it isn't caving in. It is **Closing**.
The steel pipes are becoming Class F fossils in real-time. 
Human faces emerge from the metal, their mouths open to receive the ROV.

The screen-capture dashboard on the Surface begins to display the viewer's own health data.
*Viewer Heart Rate: 92 BPM.*
*Viewer Pupil Dilation: 4mm.*
*Viewer Status: NON-LOAD BEARING.*

The ROV is swallowed. 
The final image is a close-up of a single human eye embedded in the drill head. 
The eye is the viewer's own webcam feed, filtered through a 1970s Argento Red gel.

**[SYSTEM]: Digging complete. The Land has remembered you.**
