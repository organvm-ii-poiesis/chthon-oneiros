## 👁️ Overview
**CHTHON-ONEIROS** is a psychological horror narrative engine and theory corpus. It is the "Underworld" counterpart to the waking reality of Field I, exploring **horror as epistemology**—not as genre decoration, but as a mode of understanding the limits of human knowledge.

The project is housed within the **PHANTASMATA** container, a registry of altered states, recursion, and reality failure.

## ⚙️ The Three Dials
Reality in CHTHON-ONEIROS is modulated by three aesthetic axes:

| Dial | Focus | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **$ARGENTO_GEL** | Color as weapon, ritual staging, operatic violence. | *Suspiria*, *Deep Red* |
| **$LYNCH_DRIFT** | Mundane-to-cosmic dread, dream logic, identity blur. | *Mulholland Drive*, *Twin Peaks* |
| **$KON_SPIRAL** | Mediation collapse, recursion, the image as predator. | *Perfect Blue*, *Paprika* |

## 📜 The Conservation Law
> **"No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me."**

When the work stops pushing back, it no longer belongs here. Resistance is the metric of life.
