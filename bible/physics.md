# The Physics of PHANTASMATA (v1.1)
## Laws of Reality and Constraint for Field II

**Project:** CHTHON-ONEIROS
**Organ:** II (POIESIS)
**Field:** II (Present Dreaming)
**Version:** 1.1

---

## 1. The Founding Axiom (The Conservation Law)
**"No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me."**

## 2. The Epistemological Laws

### V. The Law of Abjection ($GRINDHOUSE)
*The interior must become exterior.*
*   **Rule:** The horror is not that the machine is broken. The horror is that the machine is *alive*.
*   **The Wet-Ware Axiom:** Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from meat.

### VII. The Law of Temporal Dilation (Tarkovsky)
*Time is the material, not the measure.*
*   **Axiom (AT-A0):** Time moves at the speed of **Pressure**. In the Substrate, rhythm is determined by the felt weight of existence within the frame, not by clock-seconds.
*   **The Mosaic Effect:** Scenes are connected by **Poetic Logic** (associative/emotional resonance) rather than causal necessity. If a fragment feels like a memory, it is chronologically accurate for Ring 4.
*   **Rhythm Constraint (AT-A4):** Rhythm must arise from time-pressure within the shot. A long-take in the Sediment is not a delay; it is a compression of centuries.
