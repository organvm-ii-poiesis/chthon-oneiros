# The Physics of PHANTASMATA
## Laws of Reality and Constraint for Field II

**Project:** CHTHON-ONEIROS
**Organ:** II (POIESIS)
**Field:** II (Present Dreaming)
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. The Founding Axiom (The Conservation Law)

**"No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me."**

In PHANTASMATA, this law governs the *production of horror*. When a technique, image, or narrative structure becomes comfortable, fluent, or purely "effective" (i.e., a reliable jump scare), it loses its epistemological weight. It must be abandoned or mutated.

*   **Resistance is Metric:** If you know exactly how to write it, it is not Field II. Field II requires the uncertainty of the dream.
*   **Fluency is Failure:** Competence in genre tropes is a warning sign. The work must struggle against its own form.

## 2. The Epistemological Laws (How Reality Breaks)

PHANTASMATA is not a universe of monsters; it is a universe of *epistemological failure*. The laws of physics are replaced by the laws of dread.

### I. The Law of the Mundane Anchor ($LYNCH_DRIFT)
*Reality cannot dissolve if it was never solid.*
*   **Rule:** Every anomaly requires a precedent of banality. You must establish the "safe" world (the diner, the desktop, the commute) before you can break it.
*   **The Trapdoor Function:** The portal to the nightmare is always located in the most boring object in the room.

### II. The Law of Chromatic Aggression ($ARGENTO_GEL)
*Color is a force, not a property.*
*   **Rule:** Light does not behave physically; it behaves emotionally. Shadows do not fall where objects block light; they fall where dread accumulates.
*   **The Gel State:** When the image saturates, the rules of cause-and-effect suspend. In high-saturation zones, logic is dream-associative, not linear.

### III. The Law of Mediation Collapse ($KON_SPIRAL)
*The recording is more real than the event.*
*   **Rule:** If a camera is present, it is not a neutral observer. It is a participant. The image can consume the subject.
*   **The Recursion:** A screen showing a screen is a portal. A recording of a recording is a summoning ritual. Identity cannot survive perfect reproduction.

### IV. The Law of the Uncanny Valley (Format)
*Almost-right is worse than wrong.*
*   **Rule:** Do not make the fake look obviously fake. Do not make it look perfectly real. Make it look *almost* real, with one flaw that the mind cannot reconcile.
*   **The Glitch as Signal:** Digital corruption is not random noise; it is the fingerprint of the entity interfering with the transmission.

## 3. The "Physics" of the Artifacts

### The Conservation of Dread
Dread cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.
*   **Transfer Mechanism:** To make the viewer feel unsafe, the character must feel safe. To make the viewer feel trapped, the character must feel free (but be wrong).
*   **The Bleed:** The dread must not stay in the narrative. It must bleed into the medium (the phone, the browser).

### The Uncertainty Principle of Identity
You cannot simultaneously know *who* a character is and *where* they are.
*   If the location is stable, the identity blurs (Doppelgangers).
*   If the identity is stable, the location dissolves (Lynchian geography).

### The Law of Silence
Silence is not the absence of sound; it is the presence of a void.
*   **Acoustic Pressure:** Silence in PHANTASMATA has weight. It presses on the eardrums. It signals that the ambient world has been paused by an intruder.

## 4. Field Boundary Rules (Inter-Organ Relations)

*   **Boundary with Field I (Waking):** PHANTASMATA may *reference* Field I (real world events), but treated as distant rumors. Field I looks at Field II as "hallucination."
*   **Boundary with Field III (Temporal):** PHANTASMATA acknowledges the Past only as *Haunt* (unresolved trauma) and the Future only as *Anxiety* (dread of what is coming). Linear history does not exist here.
*   **Boundary with Field IV (Binding):** Field IV is the "Editor." It cuts the dream into sharable fragments. It is the cold, surgical hand that arranges the nightmare for consumption.
