# The Physics of PHANTASMATA (v2.0)
## Laws of Reality and Constraint for Polarity II

**Project:** CHTHON-ONEIROS
**Organ:** II (POIESIS)
**Polarity:** II (The Subconscious)
**Version:** 2.0 (Artistic Triforce Update)

## 1. The Founding Axiom (The Artistic Triforce)

**Polarity II: The Subconscious (Dream & Underworld)**

CHTHON-ONEIROS is the domain of the **Shadow**. Its function is to investigate the unconscious and reveal what lies beneath waking life. It exists in permanent tension with Polarity I (The Conscious) and is historicized by Polarity III (The Temporal).

*   **The Law of Resistance:** "No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me."
*   **The Shadow Mandate:** Every fragment must attempt to strip away the "Persona" (the socially oriented mask) to reveal the "Shadow" (the repressed Other).

## 2. The Epistemological Laws (How Reality Breaks)

### I. The Law of the Mundane Anchor ($LYNCH_DRIFT)
*Reality cannot dissolve if it was never solid.*
*   **Rule:** Every anomaly requires a precedent of banality. You must establish the "safe" world (the diner, the desktop, the commute) before you can break it.
*   **The Trapdoor Function:** The portal to the nightmare is always located in the most boring object in the room.

### II. The Law of Chromatic Aggression ($ARGENTO_GEL)
*Color is a force, not a property.*
*   **Rule:** Light does not behave physically; it behaves emotionally. Shadows do not fall where objects block light; they fall where dread accumulates.
*   **The Gel State:** When the image saturates, the rules of cause-and-effect suspend.

### III. The Law of Mediation Collapse ($KON_SPIRAL)
*The recording is more real than the event.*
*   **Rule:** If a camera is present, it is not a neutral observer. It is a participant. The image can consume the subject.
*   **The Recursion:** A screen showing a screen is a portal.

### IV. The Law of the Uncanny Valley (Format)
*Almost-right is worse than wrong.*
*   **Rule:** Do not make the fake look obviously fake. Make it look *almost* real, with one flaw that the mind cannot reconcile.

### V. The Law of Abjection ($GRINDHOUSE)
*The interior must become exterior.*
*   **Rule:** The horror is not that the machine is broken. The horror is that the machine is *alive*.
*   **The Wet-Ware Axiom:** Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from meat.

### VI. The Law of the Red Shift ($ARGENTO_GEL)
*Intensity dictates reality.*
*   **Rule:** As dread increases, the color spectrum shifts toward Red.

### VII. The Law of Temporal Dilation (Tarkovsky)
*Time is the material, not the measure.*
*   **Axiom (AT-A0):** Time moves at the speed of **Pressure**. In the Substrate, rhythm is determined by the felt weight of existence within the frame.
*   **The Mosaic Effect:** Scenes are connected by **Poetic Logic** (associative resonance) rather than causal necessity.

## 3. Field Boundary Rules (Triforce Interaction)

*   **With Polarity I (The Conscious):** CHTHON-ONEIROS consumes the "Persona" data from KRYPTO-VELAMEN and metabolizes it into symbolic nightmare.
*   **With Polarity III (The Temporal):** CHTHON-ONEIROS provides the raw "Subconscious" material that Polarity III (Narratological Lenses / LingFrame) attempts to codify into canon.

*This document governs the logic of all CHTHON-ONEIROS narratives. If a draft violates these physics without intent, it is a glitch, not a feature.*
