## 2. The Registry (New Additions)

### The Throat-Pipe (Class E)
*   **Origin:** *Cronenberg / Lynch* lineage.
*   **Appearance:** Standard galvanized steel or PVC piping that, when cut or broken, reveals biological interior (mucosa, teeth, vocal cords).
*   **Behavior:** It hums at 40Hz. It mimics human speech (The "Previous Tenant").
*   **Effect:** Transforms the home from a "Container" into a "Body." The resident is no longer a dweller; they are a parasite.
*   **Epistemology:** The "Abject" (Kristeva). The distinction between "House" and "Flesh" collapses.

### The Cable-Nerve (Class E)
*   **Origin:** *Tetsuo: The Iron Man* / *Videodrome*.
*   **Appearance:** Ethernet or HDMI cables that pulsate. If stripped, they bleed.
*   **Function:** They do not transmit data; they transmit *sensation*.
*   **Dial:** High $GRINDHOUSE + High $KON_SPIRAL.

### The Wall-Skin (Class E)
*   **Origin:** *Polanski (Repulsion)* / *Barton Fink*.
*   **Appearance:** Drywall that bruises when struck. Wallpaper that sweats.
*   **Behavior:** It creates new doors that shouldn't exist (The Trapdoor function).

## 3. Entity Rules (Update)

4.  **The Law of Calcification:** Biological entities in PHANTASMATA tend to become mechanical over time (The Giallo Killer becomes a statue).
5.  **The Law of Liquefaction:** Mechanical entities tend to become biological (The Pipe becomes a Throat).
