## 3. Entity Evolution Rules

6.  **The Law of Compression:** As entities move from the Surface to the Substrate, they lose their visual distinctness ($ARGENTO) and become pure frequency ($KON) or pure geometry ($LYNCH).
7.  **The Memory-Host Rule:** Class F entities require a "Tenant" to activate. Without a host, they are just holes. With a host, they are gods.

*The Underworld is hungry. Provide the host.*
