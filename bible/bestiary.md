## 2. The Registry

### The Static Man (Class A/D)
*   **Origin:** *Marble Hornets* lineage / Digital Pareidolia.
*   **Appearance:** A figure in the background of low-res footage. Often faceless or obscured by compression artifacts.
*   **Behavior:** Does not move when watched. Only moves between frames.
*   **Effect:** Causes video corruption and audio distortion.
*   **Epistemology:** Represents the "Wrong Presence" (Fisher).

### The Black-Gloved Killer (Class B)
*   **Origin:** *Giallo* lineage.
*   **Appearance:** Faceless, genderless figure wearing black leather gloves and a trench coat. Often wields a straight razor or stylized weapon.
*   **Behavior:** Ritualistic stalking. Operates in high-color zones. Fetishizes the act of killing.
*   **Effect:** Transforms the scene into an opera of violence.
*   **Epistemology:** Represents the "Aestheticization of Death."

### The Double (Class C)
*   **Origin:** *Lynch/Freud* lineage.
*   **Appearance:** Identical to the protagonist, but with a slight variation (wrong eye color, different smile, inverted motion).
*   **Behavior:** Mimics the protagonist, then diverges. Speaks the protagonist's private thoughts.
*   **Effect:** Causes identity dissolution.
*   **Epistemology:** Represents the "Uncanny" (Heimlich/Unheimlich).

### The Algorithm (Class A)
*   **Origin:** *Digital Paranoia* lineage.
*   **Appearance:** Non-corporeal. Manifests as notification patterns, recommendation loops, and impossible search results.
*   **Behavior:** Guiding the user to content they shouldn't see. "It knows what you fear."
*   **Effect:** Paranoia, sense of being watched.
*   **Epistemology:** Represents "Institutional Failure" / "Cosmic Indifference" (The system doesn't care about you, but it controls you).

### The Faceless Crowd (Class B/C)
*   **Origin:** *Kon/Lynch* lineage.
*   **Appearance:** A group of people with blurred faces or masks.
*   **Behavior:** They watch. They do not intervene. They are the audience.
*   **Effect:** Intensifies the "Performance" aspect of the horror.
*   **Epistemology:** Represents the "Mediation Collapse" (Observer contamination).

## 3. Entity Rules

1.  **Never Fully Revealed:** Entities lose power if fully lit and focused. Keep them in the margins (Burke's Obscurity).
2.  **Ambiguous Agency:** Is *The Algorithm* sentient, or just broken code? Is *The Double* real, or a hallucination? Keep it dual (Dual Causality).
3.  **Local Physics:** Entities obey the physics of their home ring. The *Black-Gloved Killer* cannot exist in the *Deep Drift* without mutating.

*Use this bestiary to populate the shadows. Do not overuse them. The threat of their presence is stronger than their arrival.*
