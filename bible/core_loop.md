## The 4-Stage Spiral

Every narrative fragment or arc in PHANTASMATA follows a variation of this 4-stage loop. It is designed to move the viewer from "Safe" to "Lost."

### Stage 1: The Mundane Anchor (The Hook)
*   **State:** Reality is stable.
*   **Action:** The protagonist is doing something boring/relatable (scrolling, working, commuting).
*   **Aesthetic:** Naturalistic ($ARGENTO: 0, $LYNCH: 0, $KON: 0).
*   **The Catalyst:** The **Uncanny Recognition**. A small detail is wrong. A notification. A glitch. A sound.
    *   *Example:* "Why is this file on my desktop?"

### Stage 2: The Epistemic Drift (The Descent)
*   **State:** Reality is porous.
*   **Action:** The protagonist investigates. Curiosity drives them deeper.
*   **Aesthetic:** The Dials turn up ($LYNCH: 40, $KON: 40).
*   **The Pattern:** They find more anomalies. **Pareidolia** kicks in. They start connecting dots that shouldn't connect.
    *   *Example:* "The timestamps don't match. And who is that in the background?"

### Stage 3: The Peak (The Break)
*   **State:** Reality has failed.
*   **Action:** The protagonist encounters the Entity or the Artifact directly.
*   **Aesthetic:** High Dial Intensity ($ARGENTO: 80, $LYNCH: 80, or $KON: 80).
*   **The Crisis:** **Epistemic Failure.** They cannot process what they are seeing. Terror turns to Horror (contraction).
    *   *Example:* The screen talks back. The room turns Red. The Double walks in.

### Stage 4: The Unresolved Stop (The Haunt)
*   **State:** Reality is permanently scarred.
*   **Action:** The transmission cuts. The loop resets. Or the protagonist accepts the new reality.
*   **Aesthetic:** Static, Silence, or Loop.
*   **The Residual:** **Excitation Bleed.** The viewer is left with the question: "Is this happening to me too?"
    *   *Rule:* No happy endings. No clear explanations. The mystery remains active.

## Application to Formats

*   **Video-Log:**
    1.  "Hey guys, just checking in..." (Mundane)
    2.  "Did you hear that?" (Drift)
    3.  Camera drops, running, screaming / Glitch face. (Peak)
    4.  Silence / Static. (Stop)

*   **Screen-Capture:**
    1.  Working in Excel. (Mundane)
    2.  Mouse moves on its own. (Drift)
    3.  Desktop wallpaper changes to a photo of the user. (Peak)
    4.  Blue Screen of Death / Hard Cut. (Stop)

*   **Text-Fragment:**
    1.  Normal journal entry. (Mundane)
    2.  Handwriting changes / Typing errors increase. (Drift)
    3.  Incoherent rambling / Semantic collapse. (Peak)
    4.  "I hear them coming." (Stop)

*This loop ensures every piece feels like a PHANTASMATA piece. It is the "rhythm" of the nightmare.*
