## 1. The Structure of the World

PHANTASMATA is not a contiguous map. It is a collection of "Zones" connected by "Thresholds." Distance is not measured in miles, but in *depth of drift*.

### The Concentric Rings
*   **Ring 0: The Surface (The Feed)**
    *   *Appearance:* Social media feeds, text threads, forum archives. Looks exactly like our internet.
    *   *Nature:* The entry point. The place where the anomalies are first spotted. "Safe" but contaminated.
    *   *Entities:* Users, bots, trolls, witnesses.

*   **Ring 1: The Bleed (The Digital Liminal)**
    *   *Appearance:* Glitched video calls, corrupted files, abandoned server lobbies, dead links.
    *   *Nature:* The zone where the digital infrastructure breaks down. The "Uncanny Valley" of place.
    *   *Physics:* $KON_SPIRAL dominates. Mediation collapse.

*   **Ring 2: The City of Gels (The Operatic)**
    *   *Appearance:* Urban spaces at night, bathed in impossible neon (Red, Blue, Violet). Art Deco architecture, brutalist concrete, endless corridors.
    *   *Nature:* The zone of ritual violence and high aesthetic.
    *   *Physics:* $ARGENTO_GEL dominates. Visuals override logic.

*   **Ring 3: The Deep Drift (The Subconscious)**
    *   *Appearance:* Domestic spaces that are slightly wrong (doors that don't open, hallways too long). The Red Room. The Silencio Club.
    *   *Nature:* The zone of identity dissolution.
    *   *Physics:* $LYNCH_DRIFT dominates. Dream logic is absolute.

## 2. Key Locations (The Seed Registry)

### A. The Apartment (Anchor Point)
*   **Type:** Mundane Anchor.
*   **Description:** A standard, modern urban apartment. White walls, IKEA furniture, laptop on a desk.
*   **The Horror:** It is too quiet. The geometry seems to shift when you turn around. The screen on the desk is the only window to the outside.
*   **Field:** Ring 0 -> Ring 3 gateway.

### B. The "Blue Velvet" Nightclub
*   **Type:** Giallo Set-Piece.
*   **Description:** Velvet curtains, smoky haze, overpowering blue lighting. The music is a low, throbbing synth pulse (Goblin-style).
*   **The Horror:** You are always being watched here. The performance on stage creates reality.
*   **Field:** Ring 2.

### C. The Abandoned Server Farm (The Tomb)
*   **Type:** Digital Ruin.
*   **Description:** Rows of humming racks, blinking green lights in total darkness. Cold air. The sound of fans masking whispers.
*   **The Horror:** This is where the deleted data goes. The digital ghosts live here.
*   **Field:** Ring 1.

### D. The Corridor (The Transition)
*   **Type:** Threshold.
*   **Description:** A hallway in an office building or hotel. Fluorescent flicker. Carpet pattern that induces nausea.
*   **The Horror:** It has no end. Walking down it does not bring you closer to the destination.
*   **Field:** Connecting Ring 1 and Ring 3.

## 3. Navigation Rules

1.  **No Map:** You cannot map PHANTASMATA. You navigate by *association* and *emotional resonance*.
2.  **The Screen Portal:** Screens are the primary doors. You enter Ring 1 by looking too closely at a screen in Ring 0.
3.  **The Color Shift:** A shift in lighting color signals a zone transfer. If the room turns Red, you have entered the Giallo Zone.
4.  **The Loop:** If you try to leave, you often end up back at the start (The Apartment).
