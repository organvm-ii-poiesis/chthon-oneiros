## 1. The Vertical Axis

Distance in Season 2 is measured by **Sedimentation**. We are moving past the "Rings" of the surface into the "Layers" of history and geology.

### The Substrate Layers
*   **Ring 4: The Sediment (The Historical Haunt)**
    *   *Appearance:* Underground tunnels, buried basements, dry wells, coal mines. Low-light (candle/natural). 
    *   *Nature:* The physical land's memory. This is where deleted data becomes soil. 
    *   *Physics:* **Time as Pressure.** Every hour spent here corresponds to one year passing on the Surface (Ring 0).

*   **Ring 5: The Fossil Bed (The Architectural Ancestry)**
    *   *Appearance:* Non-Euclidean structures made of bone and concrete. Buildings that grow rather than being built. 
    *   *Nature:* The zone of "The Fossils." Total immersion in the Ancient Recursion.
    *   *Physics:* $LYNCH_DRIFT at 100%. Gravity is subjective.

*   **Ring 6: The Molten Core (The Frequency Source)**
    *   *Appearance:* Blinding, white-hot feedback. 
    *   *Nature:* Pure, unmediated consciousness. The source of the three Dials.
    *   *Epistemology:* Ontological Vertigo. The viewer encounters the limit of thought.

## 2. New Locations (Season 2 Seeds)

### E. The Borehole (Gateway)
*   **Type:** Transition.
*   **Description:** A drilling site in the center of the City of Gels. It is a vertical drop into the Sediment.
*   **The Horror:** The hole doesn't just go down; it goes *back*.

### F. The Museum of the Unrecorded
*   **Type:** The Sediment Anchor.
*   **Description:** An endless archive of artifacts that were never found, events that were never recorded, and people who never existed.
*   **Field:** Ring 4.

## 3. Deep-Navigation Rules

1.  **Acoustic Guidance:** In the Sediment, sight is unreliable ($ARGENTO is muted). You navigate by sound (The Sonic Void).
2.  **Pressure Sickness:** Returning to the Surface from Ring 4 causes "Format Withdrawal." The user's own life begins to feel like a low-res recording.
3.  **The Dig:** You do not walk to the next zone; you excavate. Narrative progress requires the removal of material.

*Deep Time active. The surface is a scab.*
