## 3. Rules of Engagement

1.  **Viral Transmission:** Artifacts want to be shared. (Ringu logic).
2.  **Degradation:** Artifacts decay. `witness.mp4` gets more corrupted with each view.
3.  **Object Permanence:** Artifacts cannot be deleted. If you delete the file, it reappears in a different folder.

*These items are the "MacGuffins" of the narrative fragments. They drive the curiosity that leads to the horror.*
