## Surface Description

_What is this piece on its face? What does someone scrolling past, clicking play, or opening the file encounter first? Describe the surface experience — what format, what tone, what situation — without revealing the horror function._



---

## Horror Function Notes

_What is the dread doing? Which epistemological crisis is this piece staging? What does the audience believe at the start, and what should they doubt by the end? Where does reality become porous?_

**Reality status**: _How stable is the diegetic reality?_

**Sensory assault channel**: _Which sense carries the primary dread? (vision / sound / the gaze itself / temporal disorientation / spatial wrongness)_

**Audience position**: _Where does the viewer/reader stand? (accomplice / dreamer / watcher being watched / participant / archivist of the impossible)_

## Production Self-Check

After drafting, walk through these questions:

1. **Reality test**: Is reality porous in this piece? Can the reader/viewer point to a specific moment where the ground shifts — where what seemed real becomes questionable? If the reality is stable throughout, this is not PHANTASMATA material yet.

2. **Format consistency**: Does the piece feel native to its declared format? A video-log should have the rhythms of someone talking to a device. A screen-capture should have the visual logic of an interface. A mock-post should feel like something that could appear in a feed. If the format feels like a costume rather than a body, revise the format or the content.

3. **Dial consistency**: Do the dial settings match what you actually wrote?
   - High Argento = visible color, ritualized violence, mystery structure, aggressive scoring
   - High Lynch = dream intrusion, identity blur, mundane anchor dissolving, the hum
   - High Kon = media frame, performance outliving performer, observer contamination, memory unreliable

4. **Dread source audit**: Can you name the specific dread this piece produces? Not "it's scary" but "the dread is that the person in the video-log may not know they're being recorded" or "the dread is that the search history belongs to someone who doesn't exist." If you can't name it, the horror is decorative, not epistemological.

5. **Axis alignment**: Does the primary axis hold? If you declared $GIALLO but the piece feels more like $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS, update the metadata and consider whether the dial settings need adjustment.

6. **Lo-fi test**: Does this piece feel raw, found, diegetic? Or does it feel produced, polished, promotional? If it looks produced, it doesn't belong in PHANTASMATA yet. The audience should not be sure whether this is a creative artifact or a real document.

7. **Safety test**: If it feels safe to publish, it's not ready. Where is the risk? What about this piece would make you hesitate before releasing it into the world? That hesitation is the design intent. PHANTASMATA lives in the zone where the audience cannot determine whether what they're encountering is real.
