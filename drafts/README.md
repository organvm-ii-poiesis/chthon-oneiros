# Drafts — Field II: Present Dreaming

Multi-format creative fragments for CHTHON-ONEIROS. These are artifacts of
altered states — incomplete by design, operating at the threshold where
reality is porous, time folds, and desire and fear are indistinguishable.

## Constraints
- If it looks produced, it doesn't belong in PHANTASMATA yet
- Horror is epistemology, not genre decoration: every piece must make the
  audience question what kind of reality they are in
- Found digital over found tape: present-tense digital world as horror surface
- Raw, lo-fi, diegetic — never polished promotion
- Audience uncertainty is the design intent

## Field Boundary Rules
Material belongs in Field II (CHTHON-ONEIROS) when it:
- Originates beneath consciousness and surfaces involuntarily
- Operates through distortion, dream logic, or symbolic excess
- Makes the viewer/reader question the reality status of what they perceive
- Uses fear, obsession, compulsion, or the monstrous as structural engines

Material escapes to other fields when it:
- Becomes confessional or expository about lived experience → Field I (KRYPTO-VELAMEN)
- Develops mythic or futurist scale → Field III
- Becomes primarily formal/technical constraint work → Field IV

## Companion Note
KRYPTO-VELAMEN (Field I) asks "Is this sayable?" — text-first, concealment through language.
CHTHON-ONEIROS (Field II) asks "Is this real?" — multi-format, assault through sensation.
Different fear, same structural uncertainty. Material that crosses the boundary
should be flagged and moved, not duplicated.
