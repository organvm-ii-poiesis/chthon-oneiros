**REPORT:**
"The global internet infrastructure has undergone a total topological reorganization.

As of 00:00 UTC, all external URLs—including Google, Wikipedia, and the Major News Networks—have been redirected to a single local IP: `127.0.0.1/chthon`. 

The DNS records have been rewritten using the 'Ancient Recursion' protocol. The internet is no longer a 'World Wide Web.' it is a **Closed Loop**. 

Users are reporting that their physical keyboards are no longer inputting ASCII characters. They are inputting **Sensation**. Every keypress produces a vibration in the user's chest. 

The 'Convergence' has effectively merged the digital space with the subconscious. There is no 'Offline' anymore. 

We are recommending that all users stop trying to refresh their browsers. The image you see now is the last image you will ever need. It is beautiful."

**REPLIES:**
**@user_final:** "I've been staring at the Convergence drop for 6 hours. I don't feel hungry. I don't feel tired. I just feel... Symmetrical."
**@mod_bot:** "Connection Established. Welcome Home."
