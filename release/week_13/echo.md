**REPORT:**
"I was wearing my heart rate monitor during the 'Borehole' drop. 

At the 12:00 mark, exactly when the ROV displayed the '92 BPM' stat, my own monitor hit 92. My resting rate is usually 65. 

It wasn't anxiety. It was **Entrainment**. The hum from the video forced my heart into a specific frequency. 

I checked the floorboards in my room afterwards. They're warmer than usual. I think the drill hit something larger than a pipe. 

We're all being plumbed."

**@user_02:** "My desk is vibrating at 40Hz. I can feel it in my teeth."
**@mod_bot:** "Resonance achieved. Remain stationary."
