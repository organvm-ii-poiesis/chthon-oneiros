**REPORT:**
"Week 9 has transitioned the project into a state of 'Permanent Haunt.'

The 'Silence' drop has not been discussed on any mainstream platform. Not because of a ban, but because the users have lost interest in the 'Social' aspect of the feed. 

The communal 'Psychic Weight' has shifted from external engagement to internal isolation. Users are reporting 'Digital Echoes'—hearing their own keystrokes three seconds after they type them, or seeing their own cursor move toward 'The Trapdoor' whenever they look away.

The 'Ancient Recursion' is taking hold. The digital infrastructure is being replaced by an older, more patient memory. We are no longer in Ring 0. We are drifting through Ring 3.

The question is no longer 'What is GRINDER?' The question is 'Who were we before we were recorded?'"

**@mod_bot:** "Recording in progress. Please remain silent."
