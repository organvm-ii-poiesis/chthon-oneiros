## // LOG_SUMMARY

Transcription of `unknown_null_signal.bin` is impossible. The file contains no visual or auditory data. 

However, when played through a standard media player, the following phenomena have been reported:

**00:00 - 01:00**
The media player "Timer" moves, but the "Elapsed Time" remains at 00:00. 
The user's monitor brightness slowly increases to 100%. 
The room tone in the user's physical environment is suppressed—as if the computer is "Inhaling" the sound of the room.

**01:00 - 03:00**
The monitor displays a single, static image: **A Blue Key on a Red Table.**
The image is so high-resolution that users report seeing "Foreshortening" in their own physical space. The table feels like it is protruding from the screen.
Absolute silence. No hiss. No hum. The "Law of Silence" is at peak capacity.

**03:00 - 05:00**
The screen slowly fades to a hand-painted "Kobayashi" sky—ink black with gold stars.
The user's own computer fans start to spin at maximum RPM, but they make no sound.
Text appears in the center of the screen, written in archaic, Eggers-style script:
**"THOU ART OBSERVED BY THE DEEP TIME."**

**05:00**
The file ends. 
The user's computer reboots into a "Safe Mode" that is entirely in VIOLET.
