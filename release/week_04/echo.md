**REPORT:**
"We are observing an unprecedented event in the project rivalry. 

As of midnight, the KRYPTO-VELAMEN (QUEER) repository has gone completely offline. All existing essays have been replaced by a single, 0-byte file named `SILENCE.txt`. 

Simultaneously, the 'Psychic Weight' of the CHTHON-ONEIROS (GRINDER) project has spiked to off-the-charts levels. The audio drop 'The First Peak' has been shared over 10,000 times, but no one is posting any comments. 

There is a literal silence spreading through the community. Users who were active proponents of the QUEER 'Theory' mode are reporting that they can no longer find the words to describe what they are seeing. 

The invasion was successful. The dream has consumed the insight."
