## // AUDIO_LOG_TRANSCRIPT

**[00:00 - 00:30]**
(Total silence. But it is not a digital silence. There is a faint, background hiss—the sound of air moving through a very small space. The "Law of Silence" is at 100% intensity here. The listener is forced to turn up their volume to hear anything.)

**[00:30 - 01:00]**
(A single, metallic *TICK*. Like a pipe cooling down. Then, another *TICK*. They are not rhythmic. They are following a pattern that feels intentional.)

**VOICE (Male, whispering, barely audible):** 
"I can't... I can't stop the hum. It's coming from the sink. Not the drain. The... the porcelain itself."

**[01:00 - 02:30]**
(The silence returns, but now it is "Heavy." The background hiss changes frequency, becoming a low-frequency vibration that might cause physical discomfort in the listener.)

**VOICE:** 
"I put my ear to it. I thought I heard a name. It wasn't mine. It was... the previous tenant. The one who 'moved out' in the middle of the night."

**[02:30 - 03:00]**
(A sudden, violent EXPLOSION of sound. The "Peak" occurs. It is the sound of metal being torn apart, mixed with a high-pitched, human-like shriek. The waveform is completely clipped.)

**VOICE:** 
(Screaming) "THEY'RE NOT PIPES! THEY'RE THROATS! THE WHOLE BUILDING IS—"

**[03:00 - 04:00]**
(Absolute, digital zero silence. No hiss. No room tone. The audio file appears to still be playing, but there is no signal.)
