**REPORT:**
"The Mid-Season Climax of the CHTHON-ONEIROS project has resulted in a total epistemological collapse.

The 'Blue Velvet Nightclub' event was not a video drop; it was a **Conversion Protocol**. 

Reports are flooding in from users who claim that their 'Back' button no longer works when viewing the drop. The browser is 'locked' in the Red state. 

More disturbing are the reports from the QUEER (Krypto-Velamen) camp. Their 'Theory' repository has not just been silenced—it has been **Processed**. The files that were once academic essays on 'Present Waking' are now being re-written in real-time as 'Librettos' for the Razor Opera.

The 'Predatory Mechanism' has been fully deployed. The audience is no longer watching the hunt; they are the fuel for it. 

Psychic Weight scores have exceeded the simulation's capacity. We are moving into Phase III: The Haunt."
