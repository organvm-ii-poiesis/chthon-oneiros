## // VIDEO_LOG_TRANSCRIPT

**[00:00 - 00:15]**
(Security feed of an apartment lobby. Timestamp: 03:33 AM.
The image is monochrome, but the "Black" levels are crushed to a deep VIOLET.
The "White" levels (lights) are blowing out the sensor with a blinding, sodium ORANGE.)

**[00:15 - 00:45]**
(A resident enters. They are wearing a coat, but they are wet. It is not raining outside.
They walk to the elevator. They press the button.
The button lights up. It is not the standard yellow. It is NEON RED.
The light from the button is too strong. It illuminates the entire lobby, casting long, sharp shadows that do not match the geometry of the room.)

**[00:45 - 01:30]**
(The elevator doors open.
Inside the elevator, it is not a metal box.
The walls are draped in heavy, red velvet curtains.
The floor is wet.
The resident hesitates. They look at the camera.
Their eyes reflect the red light. They have no pupils.)

**[01:30 - 02:00]**
(The resident steps in. The doors close.
As they close, the sound is not mechanical.
It is the sound of a heavy book slamming shut. *THUD.*
The lobby lights flicker. For one frame, the walls of the lobby are replaced by raw meat.)

**[02:00]**
(Text on screen, in a font that looks like it was scratched into film emulsion:)
**"WE HAVE OPENED THE VEIN."**
