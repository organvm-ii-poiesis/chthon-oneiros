1.  **Environment:** Find a room with absolute silence.
2.  **Hardware:** Use high-quality, over-ear headphones.
3.  **Action:** Play `infrasound_layer_06.void`.
4.  **Duration:** 04:33.

## // LOG_DESCRIPTION

**00:00 - 02:00**
A 40Hz slide descending to 20Hz. 
The listener will feel a pressure in their chest. This is the **Ring 4 (Sediment)** atmosphere.

**02:00 - 04:00**
Total "Null" silence. The signal is still playing, but it is "Inhaling" the sound of the user's room. 
If the user speaks, their voice will sound "Thin," as if they are in a vacuum.

**04:00 - 04:33**
The "Acoustic Flesh" reveal. The sound of a heartbeat, but it is played through the timbre of a **Cello** being bowed with a violin string. 
This is the heart of the building.
