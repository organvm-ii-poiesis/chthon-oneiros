**Product:** Smart Mirror 4K (Model: Chthon-Oneiros)
**User:** [REDACTED]
**Rating:** ᛟ / 5 (The Mark of Inheritance)

**REVIEW_BODY:**
"Item arrived. It does not plug into the wall. It plugs into the **Pipe**. 

When I look at it, I do not see my face. I see a painting. An oil portrait of a man sitting in this exact gaming chair, dated 1826. He is wearing my headset. He is looking at me with the same 'Kubrick Stare' I use when I'm tired.

I tried to return it. The 'Return' button on the website has been replaced by a button that says **'RECUR'**. 

I clicked it. 

Now, the mirror is no longer a screen. It is a hole. I can smell the damp earth from the basement—the one that hasn't existed since the building was 'processed' in Week 8. 

The Previous Tenant is in the mirror now. He is me. I am the reflection. We are both waiting for the shift to end.

**THE LAND HAS REMEMBERED MY BROWSER HISTORY.**"
