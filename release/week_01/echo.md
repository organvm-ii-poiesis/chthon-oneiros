**POST:**
"Did anyone else catch that 'Red Corridor' leak? I tried to find the metadata. The GPS coordinates lead to a vacant lot in Milan that was demolished in 1977. But the phone used to record it... it's a model that doesn't exist yet. The serial number is just a string of prime numbers.

Also, I checked my own door handle after watching. It was cold. But it felt... soft. Like it was waiting for me to knock. 

Is this part of the 'Grinder' thing, or is something actually breaking?"

**REPLIES:**
**@user_00:** "The audio has a hidden frequency. If you invert the waveform, it sounds like a name being whispered."
**@mod_bot:** "Thread locked. Investigating information leak."
