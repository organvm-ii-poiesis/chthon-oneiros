(00:00) 
The screen is a bruised indigo. Not black. Deep, artificial purple. 
The camera lens is wet. Or maybe the air is.
The audio is a low thrum. *Thump. Thump.* Like a heartbeat in the walls.

**NARRATOR:** "Past the billboard. Past the station. The lights are magenta now. They don't cast shadows. They cast... weight."

(00:45)
He reaches a door. Red gloss. Wet to the touch. 
He knocks. It doesn't sound like wood. It sounds like flesh hitting flesh. *Slap. Slap.*

(01:20)
The door opens. A wall of blinding CRIMSON light hits the sensor. 
The narrator's voice changes. It loses its fear. 
**NARRATOR:** "Oh. It's beautiful."

(02:00)
A sound like a razor opening. *SHING.*
Total silence. 
Then, a single chord of a synthesizer—screaming, triumphant.

*If you see the magenta lights, do not look at your shadow.*
