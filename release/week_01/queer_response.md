## THE COMMODIFICATION OF THE UNDERWORLD

The recent "leak" from the CHHTON-ONEIROS corpus—the so-called 'Red Corridor'—is a textbook example of what we call **The Gilded Trap**. 

By saturating the visual field with magenta and violet gels, the producer attempts to bypass the viewer's rational faculty. It is a sensory assault disguised as art. They want you to feel "dread" so you don't have to feel "responsibility." 

Horror, in this mode, is merely a distraction from the waking world. While you are looking for prime numbers in metadata, the real world (Field I) is eroding. The 'beautiful' violence of the Giallo axis is a lie. It is the aestheticization of the void.

We propose a different mode: **Transparency**. If the Underworld wants to knock, let it. But do not call it beautiful. Call it what it is: a failure of the imagination to hold onto the light.
