**ISSUE:** "Zombie process 'Lux_V2' cannot be killed."

"I downloaded a beta filter pack last week. Ever since, I have a process running in the background called `lux_v2_daemon`. It uses 0% CPU and 0MB RAM, but it's always there. 

Whenever I look at my reflection in the monitor while the computer is off, I see the **[ROT]** overlay on my face. It's not a software glitch—the computer is unplugged. 

I tried to wipe the drive. The BIOS says the drive is 'Empty but Heavy'. 

Does anyone have the source code for this? I think the 'eye' icon is actually a pointer."
