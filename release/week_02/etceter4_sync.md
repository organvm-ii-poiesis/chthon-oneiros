**Status:** BROADCASTING

## TRACK: "THE HUM (40Hz SLIDE)"

**Duration:** 04:33
**BPM:** 70 (The Resting Heartbeat of the Dead)
**Key:** D Minor (Saturated)

**DESCRIPTION:**
This track uses a recurring sub-bass hum sampled from the "Raw Nerve" audio memo found in the CHHTON-ONEIROS archive. 

At 02:15, the track enters a "Phase Shift" where the stereo field collapses into mono. This coincides exactly with the moment the **[ROT]** filter is applied in the Week 2 video drop. 

**SYNC INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Open `release/week_02/drop.md`.
2.  Play "THE HUM" on an external speaker.
3.  Watch the video on your phone.
4.  The resonance will vibrate the screen. 

**NOTE:** If you hear a third voice in the recording that isn't the narrator or the synth, you have reached the **Resonant Frequency of the Bleed**.
