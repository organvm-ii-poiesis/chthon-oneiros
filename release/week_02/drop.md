The cursor is unresponsive. 
The system clock on the top right begins to count backwards at high speed.

The user's real webcam feed (PIP) activates. 
The user in the webcam is touching their face. They look terrified.

**CRITICAL ERROR: Reality not found. Do you wish to search online? [YES] [NO]**
