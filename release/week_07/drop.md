## // VIDEO_LOG_TRANSCRIPT

**[00:00 - 00:30]**
(Vertical phone video. Low light. A young man, "user_99", is standing in front of his bathroom mirror. He looks tired. 
The lighting is high-saturation VIOLET ($ARGENTO bonus). The shadows in the corners of the room are jagged and point toward him (Expressionist motif).)

**USER_99:** "I've been hearing it for three days. Whenever I brush my teeth. It's like... a delay. But not in the sound. In the *reflection*."

**[00:30 - 01:00]**
(He brushes his teeth. He stops suddenly.
In the mirror, the "Reflection" continues brushing for two seconds before stopping.
The "Reflection" then spits into the sink.
The "Real" user has not moved. There is no water sound in the real room, but the mirror emits a wet *SPLATCH*.)

**USER_99:** "Did you see that? It's not me. It's... it's a recording."

**[01:00 - 01:45]**
(He leans in close to the mirror. The "Omniscient Grid" symmetry is perfect.
He touches the glass.
The "Reflection" reaches out and touches the glass from the other side.
Where their fingers meet, the glass ripples like water.
The "Reflection" smiles. It is a Bergman-esque extreme close-up—the face fills the entire mirror.)

**REFLECTION:** (Voice coming from the "Real" side of the room, but the mouth is moving in the mirror) "You're late for the shift."

**[01:45 - 02:15]**
(The "Real" user tries to pull his hand away. He can't. His fingers are sinking into the mirror.
The "Reflection" begins to step *out* of the glass.
The "Real" user's body starts to turn monochrome—losing color as if it's being drained into the mirror.
The mirror surface itself turns a blinding, neon RED.)

**USER_99:** (Silent. His mouth is missing. His eyes are now just flat, black pixels.)

**[02:15]**
(The "Reflection" is now standing in the bathroom. He picks up the phone.
He looks at the camera. He has user_99's face, but his eyes are perfectly symmetrical and unblinking.
He turns the phone to the mirror.
Inside the mirror, we see the monochrome, eye-less shell of the "Real" user, trapped in the glass.)

**NEW_USER:** "Buffering complete."
