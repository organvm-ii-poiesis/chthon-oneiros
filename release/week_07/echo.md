**POST:**
"I think I found user_99. Or rather, I found his account. 

He's back online. He's posting normal stuff again. 'Good morning' selfies, food pics, gym updates. 

But look at the eyes. In every single photo, the left eye and the right eye are identical. Perfect symmetry. If you fold his face in half, there is no difference. 

And the lighting. He's in his living room, but the shadows are all pointing toward the camera. 

He's not 'back.' He's been replaced by the buffered version. The one that doesn't need to breathe. 

I'm checking my mirror tonight. I'm going to tape it over. If I see a delay, I'm smashing it."

**@glitch_tracker:** "Don't smash it. That's how they get out. The cracks are doors."
