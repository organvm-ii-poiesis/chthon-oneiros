"Did anyone archive 'The Dissolve' before it went dark? 

I watched it three times. The third time, my own webcam light turned on. I don't even have a webcam. I have a tablet. 

I checked my 'About Me' on Instagram. It changed. It says 'Currently occupying the Apartment.' I've never lived in an apartment. I live in a house. 

I think the 'Rot Filter' from last week was the primer. This week is the paint. We're all being painted over."
