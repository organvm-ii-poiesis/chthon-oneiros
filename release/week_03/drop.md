## // SCREEN_CAPTURE_TRANSCRIPT

(00:00)
Desktop of `@echo_locator`. 
*Note:* The icons on the desktop are slowly drifting to the right, as if affected by gravity. 

(00:15)
User is on a profile for `@echo_locator_real`. 
The "About" section reads: "Currently occupying the Apartment. Looking for the exit."

(00:30)
User scrolls through the "Future" photos. 
*Photo 1:* The user is at a diner. The Date is "Tomorrow". 
*Anomaly:* In the photo, the user is holding a phone that is showing *this exact moment* of the user looking at the photo.

(00:45)
User DMs `@echo_locator_real`: "Where am I?"
Reply: "You're in the screen. I'm the one breathing."

(01:00)
**The Dissolve Begins.**
The webcam window (PIP) starts to bleed into the desktop. The pixels of the user's face are literally leaking onto the wallpaper. 
The user tries to grab the webcam window with the mouse, but the cursor *passes under* the video feed. 

(01:15)
The user in the webcam PIP reaches out. A physical hand appears to grip the *bottom* of the browser window. 
The browser is pulled down, revealing the desktop wallpaper beneath. 

(01:30)
**The Wallpaper Shift:**
The wallpaper is now a live feed of the user's room, but taken from the perspective of the *monitor itself*. 
The user in the room turns around. 
The webcam feed on the screen shows the back of the user's head. 
Then, the user's head *turns 180 degrees* while the body stays still. 

(01:45)
The screen doesn't go black. It turns into a mirror. 
The cursor is the only thing left. It is blinking. 
**[SYSTEM]: User identity unlinked. Reverting to factory settings.**
