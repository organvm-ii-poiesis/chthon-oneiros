## ASSET: "WALLPAPER_01_LIVE"

**DESCRIPTION:**
A 15-second looping visual designed to look like a desktop wallpaper. 
*   **Scene:** A photo of a gaming chair in a dark room. 
*   **The Glitch:** Every 5 seconds, a hand briefly appears to grip the bottom edge of the frame, pulling it down slightly to reveal a "Blue Velvet" curtain beneath. 
*   **The Focus:** If you stare at the center of the chair, the shadows begin to resolve into a human face that matches your own. 

**INTEGRATION:**
This loop is the "canonical" wallpaper from the `@echo_locator` incident. 

**SYNC INSTRUCTIONS:**
Set this as your actual phone/desktop wallpaper. 
If the icons on your desktop begin to drift to the right, you have successfully synced with the **Ring 1: Bleed**.
