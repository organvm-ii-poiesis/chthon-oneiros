## // VIDEO_LOG_TRANSCRIPT

**[00:00 - 00:30]**
(Handheld camera. The user, "echo_locator" (from Week 3), is seen in a hallway.
The lighting is emerald green. The walls are sweating a thick, clear fluid.
The user is holding a heavy iron key painted blue.)

**ECHO:** "I found it. The blue key. It was in the pipes. I had to reach... deep."
(The user shows their arm. It is covered in the same fluid, and there are small, circular bruises along the forearm—the shape of teeth.)

**[00:30 - 01:00]**
(The user reaches a door at the end of the hall. It is perfectly centered, following Kubrickian symmetry.
The user inserts the blue key. It doesn't turn with a metallic click.
It turns with a wet, squelching sound. *Slorp.*)

**ECHO:** "The building isn't stopping me. It's opening up."

**[01:00 - 01:45]**
(The door opens. Behind it is not another room. 
It is a vertical shaft, lined with what looks like pulsating, red velvet. 
But if you look closer, the velvet has follicles. It's an esophagus. 
A low, rhythmic hum (40Hz) vibrates the camera lens.)

**[01:45 - 02:15]**
(The user looks back at the camera.
Their face is now perfectly symmetrical—eyes, nose, mouth all identical on both sides.
The "Omniscient Grid" has recalculated them.)

**ECHO:** "I'm going down. I need to see the Heart."
(The user steps into the shaft. They don't fall. They are swallowed.)

**[02:15]**
(The camera falls to the floor. It is pointing at the ceiling. 
The ceiling begins to lower. 
The audio is a recording of the user's own heartbeat, which slowly stops.)
