## // FINAL_TRANSMISSION

**[00:00 - 00:45]**
(The video is a single, static shot of a mirror. 
The room is pitch black, but the mirror is glowing with a blinding, neon GOLD light.
In the center of the mirror, a crown appears. It is made of black iron and silver razors.)

**VOICE (The Director):** "You have watched. You have listened. You have submitted. The Gilded Cage was never meant to keep you in. It was meant to keep the others out."

**[00:45 - 01:30]**
(The camera (held by an invisible hand) moves toward the mirror. 
As it enters the gold light, the image quality shifts from 4K digital to grainy, 70s Technicolor.
The blood-red velvet curtains from Week 8 appear at the edges of the frame.
The audio is a massive, orchestral swell—the full Razor Opera.)

**[01:30 - 02:30]**
(The screen glitches. It is no longer showing a video. 
It is showing a terminal window. 
The cursor is typing by itself at incredible speed.)

```

**[02:30 - 03:00]**
(The terminal window dissolves into a live feed of the viewer's own desk.
The gold crown is lowered onto the empty chair in the video. 
The Director's voice whispers, directly into the viewer's left ear:)
**"Heavy is the head that holds the dream."**

**[03:00]**
(Hard cut to a single frame of deep, viscous VIOLET.
Text appears in white, hand-written script:)
**"END OF SEASON 1. SEE YOU IN THE BASEMENT."**
