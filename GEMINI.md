# GEMINI.md — Project Context & Instructions

This file provides the authoritative context for interacting with the **CHTHON-ONEIROS** repository. It defines the project's ontological structure, creative constraints, and automated systems.

---

## 👁️ Project Overview
**CHTHON-ONEIROS** is a "Living Nightmare Engine" and psychological horror corpus. It serves as the **Polarity II (The Subconscious)** representative of the **Artistic Triforce Framework**. Its primary objective is to explore **"horror as epistemology"**—treating horror not as entertainment, but as the affect that accompanies the failure of human knowledge systems.

### Core Philosophy
- **The Artistic Triforce:** This project is the "Subconscious" polarity, focusing on hidden fears, internal conflicts, and imaginative masks (Shadow work). It is the inverse of **KRYPTO-VELAMEN** (Polarity I - The Conscious).
- **The Conservation of Resistance:** No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists its creator.
- **Audience Uncertainty:** The design intent is to maintain total ambiguity between the real and the fabricated.
- **The Shadow Instrument:** An inverse of its sibling repository (`KRYPTO-VELAMEN`), designed to dissolve identity rather than preserve it.

## 🏗️ Architectural Framework

### The Three Director Dials
All content is calibrated using these three axes of intensity (0-100):
1.  **$ARGENTO_GEL:** Focus on chromatic aggression (neon gels), ritualized violence, and operatic staging.
2.  **$LYNCH_DRIFT:** Focus on mundane-to-cosmic dread, dream logic, and the dissolution of the "Mundane Anchor."
3.  **$KON_SPIRAL:** Focus on mediation collapse, recursion, and the screen as a predatory surface.

### The Six Rings (Geography)
- **Ring 0 (The Surface):** Everyday digital life (Feeds, Tweets).
- **Ring 1 (The Bleed):** Infrastructure failure (Glitched calls, corrupted files).
- **Ring 2 (The City of Gels):** Aestheticized ritual (High Argento).
- **Ring 3 (The Deep Drift):** The Subconscious threshold.
- **Ring 4 (The Sediment):** Historical memory and geological time.
- **Ring 5 (The Fossil Bed):** Non-Euclidean architecture and calcified entities.

## ⚙️ Automated Systems (The Haunt)

The repository is animated by scripts that enforce the project's laws:

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/metabolize.sh` | **Substrate Metabolism:** Adds Unicode noise and digital decay to older files. | Daily (via `seed.yaml`) |
| `tools/giallo_check.py` | **Aesthetic Linter:** Enforces high-intensity color vocabulary (e.g., CRIMSON over red). | Pre-commit |
| `tools/update_stats.sh` | **Truth Anchoring:** Verified disk-based word counts and file indexing. | On File Change |

## 🚀 Usage & Contribution Rules

### 1. Research Protocol (The 18-Step Framework)
New director deep-dives must follow the protocol defined in `research/framework_v2.md`, moving from raw ingestion to production-ready "Systems."

### 2. Narrative Production (The Core Loop)
All narrative fragments or episodes must follow the 4-stage spiral:
1.  **Mundane Anchor:** Establish a safe, boring reality.
2.  **Epistemic Drift:** Introduce one subtle anomaly (Uncanny Recognition).
3.  **The Peak:** Total reality failure (Epistemic Crisis).
4.  **Unresolved Stop:** Hard cut to silence or static (Excitation Bleed).

### 3. Standards & Root Hygiene
- Keep the root directory pristine. 
- All new theory goes to `docs/theory/`. 
- All new production goes to `production/beta/`.
- Every change must be reflected in `docs/CATALOG.md`.
