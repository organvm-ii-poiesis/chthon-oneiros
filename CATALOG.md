### Shared Source Material

**Note on shared files:** 11 files total are shared with the companion project KRYPTO-VELAMEN. Each repository maintains its own copy as self-contained source material -- no deduplication is imposed, because each project reads these documents through its own field lens. GRINDER asks *"Is this real?"* while QUEER asks *"Is this sayable?"* -- different fear, same structural uncertainty.

The complete list of shared files:

1. Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md
2. ChatGPT-Demons in Paradise Lost.md
3. ChatGPT-Grinder Blair Witch Fear.md
4. ChatGPT-GRINDER Project Threads Summary.md

## Concept Index

An alphabetical index of core concepts, craft mechanisms, and aesthetic influences referenced across the corpus. Document filenames indicate where each concept is defined or substantially discussed.

- **Archival Provenance** -- Three "Open View" screenplay drafts (2018--2019) constitute the earliest archival source material for the GRINDER/CHTHON-ONEIROS concept. Establishes that the core conceit predates any AI-assisted development and was incubated through traditional screenwriting practice. See: GRINDER-New-chat.md

- **Conservation Law** -- "No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me." Resistance is a conserved quantity that cannot be optimized, automated, or faked. When the work stops pushing back, it no longer belongs where it is. See: Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md

- **Digital Paranoia** -- Found footage updated into found digital: glitched calls, corrupted audio, abandoned profiles, disappearing posts, forum threads, intercepted calls, staged leaks. Reproduces the late-1990s "it might be real" fear profile transposed into present-tense digital world. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Double-Channel Text** -- Writing engineered to operate on two simultaneous frequencies: surface story and substrate story. The hiding is not a defect but an aesthetic of constrained transmission. Central to krypto-velamen (Field I); referenced in chthon-oneiros as a shared concept across the companion pair. See: README.md (references)

- **Eight-Organ System** -- The organvm: full governance architecture for all AJP Media Arts creative projects. First articulated in defining-organ-orchestration.md (~84K words) within the GRINDER project space. The system now governs far more than this project, but this is where it was born. See: defining-organ-orchestration.md

- **Found-Footage Framework** -- Core narrative told as "found" recordings: video logs, livestream archives, phone footage. Characters address the camera directly. Operational model: The Blair Witch Project (1999) -- collapse of narrative authority. Updated from "found tape" into found digital. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Four-Field Model** -- Governance model for lifetime creative labor. Four fields: I (Present Waking), II (Present Dreaming), III (Temporal Antagonism), IV (Binding/Translation). Core rule: resistance is conserved. Reference artists: Whitman (I), Joyce (all), Tarkovsky (II), Kubrick (III), Tarantino (IV). See: Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md

- **Giallo** -- Dario Argento's neon-drenched nightmare logic. Bold color gels, operatic murder set-pieces, non-linear mystery structure, mythic killer figure. Scored with pounding percussion and hypnotic rhythms (Goblin, Morricone). See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Grindhouse Exploitation** -- Raw, visceral, gritty aesthetic from 1970s--80s exploitation cinema. Grainy, scratched, lo-fi visual texture. Urban decay production design. Shaky amateur camerawork, graphic violence with unflinching immediacy. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Hybrid Camera Style** -- Unsteady POV shots mixed with Lynchian fixed compositions. Frantic handheld during action, sudden bursts of steadied focus to disorient. Subjective inserts of objects for eeriness. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Layered Sound Design** -- 1970s prog/rock and eerie synths. Diegetic sound prioritized: microphone hiss, distant traffic, breathing. Lynchian silence as tool: abrupt dropouts amplify dread. Glitchy digital audio for the digital paranoia register. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Lo-fi Editing** -- Found footage sequences feel unedited. Dream sequences use montage: dissolving overlapping images. Murder scenes switch to rapid intercutting. Transitions use glitch or retro effects to signal perspective shifts. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Lynchian Surrealism** -- David Lynch: mundane settings that implode into cosmic dread. Dream logic prevails in pivotal scenes: narrative slips into hallucination without warning. Symbolic imagery recurs. Terror from not knowing what kind of reality you are in anymore. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **PHANTASMATA Container Concept** -- Registry of altered states: a house for works generated by dreams, hallucination, obsession, fear, taboo, recursion, and symbolic leakage. Container-level mandate: works where reality is porous, time folds or stutters, desire and fear are indistinguishable. See: GRINDER-Scope-correction-and-terrain.md

- **Psychological/Subconscious Themes** -- Perfect Blue (1997) as primary reference. Characters spiral into madness, questioning their sanity. Supernatural aspects left deliberately ambiguous. Obsession and paranoia as structural engines, not genre decoration. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

- **Scope Correction** -- Critical architectural move: from single story (GRINDER hookup-app murder premise) to container/field (PHANTASMATA/CHTHON-ONEIROS). Horror is not the genre -- it is the symptom language of the terrain. See: GRINDER-Scope-correction-and-terrain.md

- **Social/Viral Diegetic Material** -- Short lo-fi video clips, mock social posts, audio teasers, live/interactive content designed to look like evidence from within the world, not polished promotion. Audience uncertainty is the design intent. See: GRINDER-Creative-Concept-Clarification.md, README.md

## Influence Index

### Three Aesthetic Axes

| Axis | Key Figure | Core Works | Contribution |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Giallo | Dario Argento | Suspiria, Deep Red, Tenebrae | Neon color gels, operatic murder, non-linear mystery |
| Surrealism | David Lynch | Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway | Dream logic, reality dissolution, cosmic dread |
| Found Footage | Blair Witch Project | The Blair Witch Project (1999) | Collapse of narrative authority, digital paranoia |

### Influence Clusters

**Visual Horror** -- Grindhouse exploitation (The Driller Killer, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Cannibal Holocaust): raw texture, lo-fi grain, urban decay, unflinching immediacy.

**Dream Logic** -- Lynchian surrealism + psychological/subconscious themes (Perfect Blue): madness spirals, ambiguous supernatural, obsession as structure.

**Raw/Exploitation** -- 1970s--80s grindhouse cinema: analog artifacts, VHS noise, film grain, sleazy content, shaky camerawork.

**Reference Artists (Four-Field Validation)** -- Walt Whitman (Field I), James Joyce (all fields), Andrei Tarkovsky (Field II), Stanley Kubrick (Field III), Quentin Tarantino (Field IV). Each exemplifies one field's characteristic resistance and creative mode.

## Duplicate and Overlap Notes

1. **Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md** (chthon-oneiros) and **QUEER-Temporal-Work-and-Struggle.md** (krypto-velamen) are byte-identical (22,929 bytes each). The unprefixed version here is the original shared source document; the QUEER-prefixed version in krypto-velamen is the project-local copy.

2. **defining-organ-orchestration.md** (84,055 bytes) and **ChatGPT-Demons in Paradise Lost.md** (448,252 bytes) are **NOT** duplicates. Different sizes, different content. The organ document is the genesis conversation for the eight-organ system; the Demons document is extended Paradise Lost/demonology research.

3. **ChatGPT-QUEER Growth Strategy.md** and **ChatGPT-Queer Project Growth Strategy.md** are distinct documents despite similar names. The first (1,226 words) covers public creation strategy for both QUEER and GRINDER. The second (2,426 words) is a detailed three-phase growth plan with platform strategy and community building.

4. **ChatGPT-Project Threads Summary.md** exists in krypto-velamen but is **not present** in chthon-oneiros. The GRINDER-specific equivalent is **ChatGPT-GRINDER Project Threads Summary.md**.
