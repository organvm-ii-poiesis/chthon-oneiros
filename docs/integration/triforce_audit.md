# The Triforce Audit: Inter-Repository Dynamics
## Mapping Polarity II within the Artistic Triforce

**Project:** CHTHON-ONEIROS
**Organ:** IV (Binding) / III (Temporal)
**Status:** Canonical

---

## 1. The Core Duality (I ↔ II)

The relationship between **KRYPTO-VELAMEN** (Polarity I) and **CHTHON-ONEIROS** (Polarity II) is one of **Inversion and Digestion**.

| Dimension | KRYPTO-VELAMEN (Polarity I) | CHTHON-ONEIROS (Polarity II) |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | The Persona (Self-Reflection) | The Shadow (Imaginative Masks) |
| **Logic** | Social Realism / Transparency | Dream Logic / Distortion |
| **Goal** | Preservation of Agency | Dissolution of Self |
| **Medium** | The Archive (The Ark) | The Engine (The Stomach) |

**The Transfer Point:** When a work in KRYPTO-VELAMEN reaches a state of "Critical Pressure"—where reality can no longer hold the weight of the insight—it "Flips" into CHTHON-ONEIROS.

## 2. The Temporal Bridge (II ↔ III)

**Polarity III (The Temporal)** acts as the "Scholar" and "Archaeologist" of the other two polarities. It consists of the **Linguistic Atomization Framework (LingFrame)** and the **Narratological Algorithmic Lenses**.

### LingFrame: The Metabolic Scalpel
*   **Role:** Analyzes the "Subconscious" fragments of CHTHON to extract the **Infectious Phoneme**.
*   **Output:** The `tools/lingframe/lexicon.yaml` which defines the linguistic fingerprint of dread.

### Narratological Lenses: The Genetic Map
*   **Role:** Extracts the recurring "Algorithms" (Tarkovsky, Kubrick, etc.) from historical masterworks.
*   **Output:** The `bible/physics.md` laws which govern the behavior of Ring 5 Fossils.

## 3. The Triforce Synthesis

Every creative artifact produced in this repository must undergo the following **Triforce Processing**:

1.  **Extraction (III):** Identify the Narrative Algorithm (e.g., "Tarkovsky Dilation").
2.  **Atomization (III):** Process the language through the CHTHON Lexicon.
3.  **Metabolism (II):** Ingest a "Persona" leak from Polarity I.
4.  **Fossilization (II):** Produce the final Narrative Episode for the Museum.
