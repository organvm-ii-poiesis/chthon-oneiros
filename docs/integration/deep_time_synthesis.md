# Integration Thesis: The Deep Time Synthesis
## Incorporating LingFrame & Narratological Algorithmic Lenses

**Objective:** Map the relationship between CHTHON-ONEIROS and its theoretical substrate repositories.

---

## ✦ Overview
To move from "Campaign" to "System," CHTHON-ONEIROS must anchor itself in the computational and structural research established in its companion repositories. We are treating these external repos as the **Ancient Archives** from which the current nightmare is derived.

## 1. LingFrame: The Metabolic Engine
*Repository: `linguistic-atomization-framework`*

**The Inverse Mapping:**
*   **LingFrame (Theory):** Hierarchical Atomization (Theme → Letter).
*   **CHTHON (System):** **Hierarchical Digestion.** 
    *   The "Atom" is not a unit of meaning; it is a unit of **Fossilization**. 
    *   LingFrame's "Shatter Points" are redefined as the **Epistemic Breach Points** where the Underworld enters the text.
*   **Application:** 
    *   `tools/metabolize.sh` will eventually utilize LingFrame's "Atomizer" logic to identify specific "Words" for "Semantic Satiation."
    *   **Exhibit X:** "The LingFrame Protocol"—an occult software that atomizes human testimony until only the "Infectious Phoneme" remains.

## 2. Narratological Lenses: The Genetic Library
*Repository: `narratological-algorithmic-lenses`*

**The Inverse Mapping:**
*   **Lenses (Theory):** Formalizing craft into implementable algorithms.
*   **CHTHON (System):** **Formalizing the Curse.**
    *   The "Narrative Algorithms" (Tarkovsky, Kubrick, Lynch) are the **Physics of Ring 5 (The Fossil Bed)**. 
    *   These aren't just techniques; they are the "Genetic Code" of the Fossils.
*   **Application:**
    *   Extract algorithms from `specs/02-completed-studies/` and re-codify them as **Bestiary Class F behaviors**.
    *   **Exhibit Y:** "The Tarkovsky Sample"—a piece of time-pressure film recovered from the Molten Core.

## 3. The Combined Cycle (Field IV Expansion)

**Ingestion Loop:**
1.  **Extract:** Pull a "Lens" from `narratological-algorithmic-lenses`.
2.  **Atomize:** Process the lens through `linguistic-atomization-framework`.
3.  **Metabolize:** Convert the atomized data into a CHTHON Narrative Episode.
4.  **Fossilize:** Store the result in `museum/` as a "Recovered Artifact."

*This integration ensures that every "Glorious Propulsion" is backed by exhaustive technical and theoretical rigor.*
