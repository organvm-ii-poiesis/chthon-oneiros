# CHTHON-ONEIROS: SEASON 2 MEGA-PLAN
## "The Deep Time" & Field IV Activation

**Objective:** Expand the corpus vertically (into history/geology) and horizontally (into binding/publishing).

---

## Phase 1: Field IV Activation (The Binding)
*Goal: Transmute the 680k-word Season 1 corpus into a durable artifact.*

1.  **Project: "The Black Book" (Season 1 Bible)**
    *   **Compile:** Aggregate `bible/`, `research/`, and `release/` into a single, linearized manuscript `docs/THE_BLACK_BOOK_S1.md`.
    *   **Edit:** Apply "Field IV" rigor. Remove redundancy. Standardize terminology.
    *   **Output:** A "Showrunner's Bible" that could theoretically be handed to a production studio.

---

## Phase 2: Season 2 Architecture (The Deep Time)
*Goal: Define the "Substrate" logic for the next narrative cycle.*

1.  **New Geography: Ring 4 (The Sediment)**
    *   *Concept:* The physical land beneath the city. The "Previous Tenant" isn't a person; it's a geological layer.
    *   *Physics:* **Time as Pressure.** The deeper you go, the slower time moves.
    *   *Asset:* `bible/geography_v2.md` (Update).

2.  **New Entity Class: Class F (The Fossils)**
    *   *Concept:* Entities that are not dead, but *calcified*. They are part of the architecture.
    *   *Reference:* *The Enigma of Amigara Fault* (Junji Ito) meets *The Thing*.
    *   *Asset:* `bible/bestiary_v2.md` (Update).

---

## Phase 3: Research Expansion (The New Clusters)
*Goal: Exhaustive ingestion of "Substrate" horror.*

1.  **Cluster 6: The Sonic Void (Sound as Excavation)**
    *   *Targets:* **Jonathan Glazer** (*Under the Skin*), **Peter Strickland** (*Berberian Sound Studio*), **Hildur Guðnadóttir** (Chernobyl).
    *   *Theme:* Sound that reveals the hollow earth.

2.  **Cluster 7: The Architecture of Hell (Space as Crusher)**
    *   *Targets:* **Brutalist Architecture**, **The Backrooms**, **Piranesi**, **Mark Z. Danielewski** (*House of Leaves*).
    *   *Theme:* Non-Euclidean spaces that digest the occupant.

3.  **Cluster 8: The Viral Semiotics (Language as Virus)**
    *   *Targets:* **Pontypool** (Tony Burgess), **Snow Crash** (Neal Stephenson), **William Burroughs**.
    *   *Theme:* Words that rewrite the DNA of the speaker.

---

## Phase 4: Production Beta (The Episodes)
*Goal: Move from "Fragments" to "Episodes."*

1.  **Format Shift:**
    *   From `fragments/` (1-2 min reads) to `episodes/` (10-15 min reads).
    *   Structure: Multi-perspective, cross-media narratives.

2.  **Pilot Episode: "The Core Sample"**
    *   *Plot:* A construction crew in "The City of Gels" drills too deep and hits a "Cable-Nerve" the size of a subway tunnel. It bleeds.
    *   *Dial:* High $GRINDHOUSE (Visceral) + High $LYNCH_DRIFT (Deep Time).

---

## Execution Order
1.  **Bind:** Create `THE_BLACK_BOOK_S1.md`. (Close the door on S1).
2.  **Architect:** Define `Ring 4` and `Class F` in the Bible.
3.  **Research:** Execute Cluster 6 (Sound).
4.  **Produce:** Draft "The Core Sample."
