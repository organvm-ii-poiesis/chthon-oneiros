# CHTHON-ONEIROS: Multi-Modal Research Mega-Plan
## Phase IV: The Total Ingestion (Past & Contemporary)

**Objective:** To build an exhaustive, cross-media knowledge base of the "Subconscious" polarity by analyzing past and contemporary masters across text, film, audio, and the web.

---

## 1. Research Modalities

To achieve "Exhaustive" status, the research must ingest data across four primary streams:

| Modality | Target Data | Extraction Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **FILM** | Visual grammar, pacing, lighting, staging. | The "Director Dials" ($ARGENTO, $LYNCH, $KON). |
| **TEXT** | Interiority, linguistic viruses, narrative gaps. | The "Infectious Phoneme" (LingFrame Lexicon). |
| **AUDIO** | Infrasound, resonance, industrial silence, voice. | The "Sonic Void" (Excavation Frequency). |
| **WEB** | Interface horror, digital paranoia, recursion. | The "Gateway Protocol" (Mediation Collapse). |

## 2. New Research Clusters (The Roadmap)

We are expanding the roadmap from 12 to 20 clusters to cover the full depth of the Underworld.

### Cluster 13: The Auditory Abyss (Audio)
*   **Focus:** Dark ambient, industrial, and soundscapes that produce physiological dread.
*   **Targets:** **Lustmord** (The Heretic), **Coil** (The Ape of Naples), **Burial** (Untrue), **Sunn O)))** (Infrasound).
*   **Goal:** Define the "Acoustic Flesh" of Ring 6.

### Cluster 14: The Literary Shadow (Text)
*   **Focus:** Weird fiction, psychological stasis, and linguistic decay.
*   **Targets:** **Thomas Ligotti** (Conspiracy Against the Human Race), **Robert Aickman** (Strange Stories), **Shirley Jackson** (The Haunting of Hill House), **Mark Z. Danielewski** (House of Leaves).
*   **Goal:** Refine the "Subconscious" interiority logic.

### Cluster 15: The Digital Leak (Web/Digital)
*   **Focus:** Internet-native horror and the "Uncanny Valley" of the interface.
*   **Targets:** **Analog Horror** (Local 58, Gemini Home Entertainment), **The Backrooms** (Kane Pixels), **Net Art** (Jodi.org), **E-Gore/Shock Sites** (The logic of the forbidden link).
*   **Goal:** Codify the "Ring 1: The Bleed" mechanics.

### Cluster 16: The Surrealist Ancestry (Past Masters)
*   **Focus:** The 20th-century roots of dream cinema.
*   **Targets:** **Luis Buñuel** (Un Chien Andalou), **Maya Deren** (Meshes of the Afternoon), **Jan Švankmajer** (Dimensions of Dialogue), **Quay Brothers** (Street of Crocodiles).
*   **Goal:** Map the "Genetic Logic" of Ring 3 (Deep Drift).

### Cluster 17: The Modern Bleed (Contemporary)
*   **Focus:** Post-horror and the aestheticization of trauma.
*   **Targets:** **Panos Cosmatos** (Beyond the Black Rainbow, Mandy), **Julia Ducournau** (Titane), **Jordan Peele** (Nope), **Robert Eggers** (The Lighthouse).
*   **Goal:** Identify the "Present Day" state of the Giallo/Subconscious axis.

## 3. The 18-Step Execution Cycle

Every cluster will follow the **Framework V2** protocol, but with multi-modal enhancements:

1.  **Multi-Modal Ingestion:** Simultaneously read the text, watch the film, and listen to the soundtrack of a work.
2.  **Resonance Mapping:** Use LingFrame to identify cross-modal patterns (e.g., how a specific word in a script triggers a specific frequency in the score).
3.  **Inter-Repo Fossilization:** Automatically generate a **Museum Exhibit** for every 3 clusters completed.

---

## 4. Phase Schedule (The Propulsion)

*   **Sprints 1-2 (The Wave):** Execute Clusters 13 (Audio) and 14 (Text).
*   **Sprints 3-4 (The Wire):** Execute Cluster 15 (Web) and 16 (Ancestry).
*   **Sprints 5-6 (The Now):** Execute Cluster 17 (Contemporary) and 18 (Synthesis).

## 5. Integration with Polarity III (The Canon)

The results of this research will be fed into **Narratological Algorithmic Lenses** to create "Master Lenses" for each modality. 
*   *Example:* The **"Ligotti Lens"** for text generation. 
*   *Example:* The **"Cosmatos Lens"** for visual/color generation.

*Plan drafted for CHTHON-ONEIROS (Polarity II). Execution requires immediate activation of Cluster 13.*
