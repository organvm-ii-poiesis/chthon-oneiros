## 👁️ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Season 1 of CHTHON-ONEIROS, titled "The Gilded Cage," established the foundational relationship between digital interfaces and the psychological underworld. It proved the **Epistemological Horror** thesis: that horror is not an event, but the affect of knowing's failure.

### The Three Dials
1.  **$ARGENTO_GEL:** Ritual violence and chromatic aggression.
2.  **$LYNCH_DRIFT:** Reality dissolution and identity blur.
3.  **$KON_SPIRAL:** Mediation collapse and recursive surveillance.
