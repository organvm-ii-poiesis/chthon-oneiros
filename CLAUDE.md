## Project Overview
CHTHON-ONEIROS (GRINDER) — a theory corpus and creative container
for psychological horror, surrealism, found footage, and the unconscious
as compositional engine. Field II: Present Dreaming. Organ II: POIESIS (Art).
Container: PHANTASMATA — registry of altered states.

## Core Model: 5 Aesthetic Axes
- $GRINDHOUSE: raw exploitation texture (grain, VHS noise, urban decay, unflinching immediacy)
- $GIALLO: Argento-derived color-as-weapon (bold gels, operatic murder, non-linear mystery)
- $LYNCH: mundane-to-cosmic implosion (dream logic, identity blur, suburban dread)
- $FOUND_FOOTAGE: collapse of narrative authority (found digital, glitched calls, abandoned profiles)
- $PSYCHO_SUBCONSCIOUS: Perfect Blue register (madness spiral, ambiguous supernatural, obsession-as-structure)

## 6 Craft Mechanisms
1. Found-footage framework (video logs, livestream archives, phone footage)
2. Unnatural color and saturation (bold gels against monochrome, dramatic uneven lighting)
3. Hybrid camera style (unsteady POV mixed with Lynchian fixed compositions)
4. Layered sound design (70s prog/synth, diegetic hiss, Lynchian silence, glitchy digital)
5. Lo-fi editing (raw found footage, dream montage, rapid intercutting murder)
6. Social/viral diegetic material (lo-fi clips, mock posts, audio teasers as in-world evidence)

## Three Director Dials
- $ARGENTO_GEL (0-100): Color saturation, ritual staging, operatic violence, Goblin-score intensity
- $LYNCH_DRIFT (0-100): Dream intrusion, mundane anchor dissolution, identity blur, industrial sonic
- $KON_SPIRAL (0-100): Mediation collapse, performance haunt, obsession recursion, memory unreliability

## Project Constraints
- Horror as epistemology, not genre decoration
- Scope correction: from single story (hookup-app murder) to container/field
- Container mandate: works where reality is porous, time folds, desire and fear are indistinguishable
- Companion project: KRYPTO-VELAMEN (Field I: Present Waking)
- 11 shared source documents with companion
- No AI elements in creative identity (AI assists process, not product)

## Research Pipeline
- 3 anchor director deep research reports (Argento, Lynch, Kon)
- Each report: A) Executive Summary, B) Corpus Map, C) Systems Model, D) Mechanics Atlas
- Research output goes in research/ directory

## Directory Structure
- *.md (root): Theory corpus and source material (20 documents)
- CATALOG.md: Structured document index
- seed.yaml: Automation contract
- research/: Generated research reports (anchor directors, craft analysis)
- drafts/: Multi-format creative fragments (Field II production)

## External Stores
- Knowledge Graph: MCP (50 entities, 100 relations)
- Neon DB: project plain-wind-21545579
- Companion Neon DB: project snowy-moon-43700360 (KRYPTO-VELAMEN)

## Creative Output Parameters
- Multi-format: video-log, screen-capture, audio-log, text-fragment, mock-post
- Found digital over found tape: present-tense digital world as horror surface
- Raw, lo-fi, diegetic — never polished promotion
- If it looks produced, it doesn't belong in PHANTASMATA yet
- Audience uncertainty is the design intent
