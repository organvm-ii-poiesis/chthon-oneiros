## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this is a creative theory corpus, "vulnerabilities" typically refer to:
1.  **Secret Leakage:** Accidental inclusion of API keys or private data.
2.  **Epistemic Corruption:** Breaches of the project's internal logic/laws.

Please report any issues to the project maintainer.
