# Contributing to CHTHON-ONEIROS

Thank you for your interest in the PHANTASMATA Underworld-Dream Theory Corpus. This project operates under the **Four-Field Model** of creative labor.

## Field II Constraints
As a Field II (Present Dreaming) repository, contributions must adhere to the following:
1.  **Epistemological Integrity:** Content must explore horror as a mode of knowing, not merely as decoration.
2.  **Aesthetic Alignment:** Use the **Director Dials** ($ARGENTO, $LYNCH, $KON) to calibrate contributions.
3.  **Resistance Law:** "No work may remain in a field where it no longer resists me."

## Workflow
1.  **Read the Bible:** All contributions must obey the laws defined in `bible/physics.md`.
2.  **Use Templates:** Draft narrative fragments using `drafts/TEMPLATE.md`.
3.  **Update Catalog:** Any new file addition must be reflected in `CATALOG.md`.

## Standard Procedures
- **Branching:** Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `fragment/neon-bleed`).
- **Commits:** Follow conventional commit messages.
