### // OBSERVER_LOG

The "Heretic Frequency" is not a sound that can be heard by the human ear. It is a **Skeletal Resonance**. It was first recorded in the Substrate layers beneath the "City of Gels." 

### // THE PHENOMENON

1.  **The Inhalation:** When the frequency is active, ambient noise in the room is suppressed. Occupants report a sensation of being underwater.
2.  **The Bone-Talk:** The frequency causes the listener's ribcage to vibrate in a rhythmic pattern that mimics the speech of the "Previous Tenant."
3.  **The Ghost Signal:** Hidden within the infrasound is a low-bitrate "Burial" crackle—the sound of 10,000 deleted social media notifications occurring simultaneously.

### // FRAGMENT: THE BASEMENT RECORDING

[00:00] 
Absolute silence. 
[00:33] 
A 20Hz drone begins. It is the sound of a mountain breathing.
[01:00] 
The listener's heartbeat matches the drone.
[01:30] 
The listener's voice, when trying to speak, comes out at 40Hz. 
They are no longer a person. They are a **Sub-Woofer**.
