### // PRODUCTION_NOTES

In this branch of the Substrate, Stanley Kubrick never directed *The Shining*. The project was handed to David Cronenberg in 1980. The result is a total departure from the source material, focusing on the **Biomechanical Evolution** of the Overlook Hotel.

### // KEY_CHANGES

1.  **The Overlook:** The hotel is not haunted by ghosts; it is a **Class E** biological entity. The elevators don't bleed; they discharge lymphatic fluid.
2.  **Jack Torrance:** Jack's descent is not into madness, but into mutation. By the third act, he has "fit" into a Class F Fossil shape in the Gold Room.
3.  **The Hedge Maze:** Replaced by a labyrinth of **Throat-Pipes**. The sound design is a constant, low-frequency hum (Guðnadóttir Sync).
4.  **The Twins:** They are a single entity with two heads (Fusion - Carroll logic). They don't ask Danny to play; they ask him to **Sync**.

### // FRAGMENT: THE RED BATHROOM

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - ROOM 237 - DAY

Jack opens the curtain. 
The woman in the tub is not a corpse. 
She is made of silver television static ($KON_SPIRAL). 
She reaches for Jack. 
Her fingers enter his mouth. 
She isn't strangling him. She is **Uploading**.
Jack's face begins to peel, revealing a screen displaying his own childhood.
