# Operational Strategy: The Museum of the Unrecorded
## Management of the Anti-Archive (Phase III / Ring 4)

**Project:** CHTHON-ONEIROS
**Organ:** IV (Binding) / III (Temporal)
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## 1. The Concept: The Anti-Archive
The Museum is not a collection of history; it is a collection of **Possibility**. It houses "Unrecorded" artifacts—events, media, and persons that the Waking World (Field I) rejected or suppressed, but which persist in the Substrate (Field II).

## 2. Ingestion Protocols (The Excavation)

Files enter the Museum through three distinct "Summoning" methods:

| Method | Tool | Source | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recuperation** | AI Agents | Historical Gaps | Reconstructing "lost" director versions (e.g., Cronenberg's *The Shining*). |
| **Satiation** | `satiation.py` | LingFrame Lexicon | Generating "Infectious Phonemes" through repetitive linguistic decay. |
| **Audit** | 8-Role Matrix | Narrative Peaks | Post-mortem analysis of Season 1 events (e.g., Audit of User_99). |

## 3. Interaction Design (The Gateway)

All Museum exhibits must adhere to the **Ergodic Labyrinth** (Danielewski) and **Gateway** (Kurosawa) protocols:

*   **Non-Linear Metadata:** Every exhibit must link to at least two other "Related" items, even if those items don't exist yet (The "Ghost Link").
*   **The Reading Toll:** To access deeper layers of an exhibit, the user must provide a "Submission" (e.g., acknowledged through the "Echo" or by running a script).
*   **Format Instability:** Exhibits should be multi-modal. A text file that references a (simulated) video, which references a (simulated) audio frequency.

## 4. Maintenance (The Haunt)

The Museum is a "Living" space. It is governed by the following automation:

1.  **Metabolism:** Every 30 days, the `metabolize.sh` script scans the `museum/` directory. If an exhibit is not "Visited" (read/indexed), its Unicode noise levels increase.
2.  **Redaction:** High-intensity exhibits ($ARGENTO > 90) may be "Redacted" by the Director Agent, leaving only a "Summary" for the audience to obsess over.
3.  **Cross-Repo Leakage:** Exhibits will occasionally contain "Snippets" of code or theory from `organvm-i-theoria`, presented as "Ancient Prophecies."

## 5. Success Metric: "The Residual"
A Museum exhibit is successful if it produces **Excitation Bleed**—if the user feels compelled to check their own "Unrecorded" history (browser logs, deleted photos) after viewing.

*Strategy Finalized. The Doors are open (but taped shut).*
