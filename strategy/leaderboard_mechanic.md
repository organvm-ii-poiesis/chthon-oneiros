# The Competitive Tension Mechanic
## Gamifying the Epistemological Crisis

**Objective:** Use the rivalry between GRINDER (Horror), QUEER (Theory), and ETCETER4 (Sound) to drive engagement.

## 1. The Metric: "Psychic Weight"

We do not track "likes." We track **Psychic Weight**.
*   **GRINDER generates Fear (Red).**
*   **QUEER generates Insight (Blue).**
*   **ETCETER4 generates Vibe (Green).**

### How it Works
Each week, the project with the highest "Weight" dictates the **aesthetic** of the next week's shared asset.
*   *If GRINDER wins:* The shared asset is Glitched/Scary.
*   *If QUEER wins:* The shared asset is Analytical/Dense.
*   *If ETCETER4 wins:* The shared asset is Rhythmic/Looping.

## 2. Tracking Methods

### Method A: The Discord Poll (Low Tech)
*   Simple poll: "Which kept you up at night?"
*   Winner gets the badge.

### Method B: The "Bleed" Count (Medium Tech)
*   Count specific hashtags. `#chthon` (Fear) vs `#velamen` (Insight).

### Method C: The Hidden Token (High Tech)
*   Hide a unique string (Token) in each project's drop.
*   First project to have its token found/posted by a user "wins."
*   *Example:* GRINDER hides a hex code in `fragment_01`. QUEER hides a Latin phrase in its essay.

## 3. The "Invasion" Protocol

When one project wins 3 weeks in a row, it gains the right to **Invade** another project.
*   **The Invasion:** The winner posts a file in the loser's repository (or feed).
*   *Example:* GRINDER wins. A "Corrupted" version of a QUEER essay appears on the QUEER blog.

---

## 4. The "Truce" Protocol

If engagement drops below a threshold, the projects declare a **Truce**.
*   **The Truce:** They release a collaborative work (The "Convergence" in Week 11).
*   *Why:* To re-consolidate the audience before the finale.
